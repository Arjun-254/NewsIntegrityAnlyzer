The leopard spot–like features speckling the clay-colored part of the rock resemble structures in Earth rocks that are associated with life.MSSS/JPL-Caltech/NASABy Lisa GrossmanJuly 25, 2024 at 7:52 pmNASA’s Perseverance rover has bagged its first hint of ancient microbes on Mars.“We’re not able to say that this is a sign of life,” says Perseverance deputy project scientist Katie Stack Morgan of NASA’s Jet Propulsion Lab in Pasadena, Calif.  “But this is the most compelling sample we’ve found yet.”The rover drilled up the sample on July 21 from a reddish rock, dubbed Cheyava Falls after a feature at the Grand Canyon. It is the first piece of Mars that Perseverance has examined that contains organic molecules, the building blocks of life, project scientist Ken Farley of Caltech reported July 25 at the 10th International Conference on Mars in Pasadena.This isn’t the first sign of organics on Mars — the Curiosity rover detected organic molecules in a region called Gale Crater in 2014 (SN: 12/16/14). But scientists have struggled to identify organics since Perseverance landed in an ancient dried-up lake called Jezero Crater in 2021, says Stack Morgan (SN: 2/17/21).Adding to the excitement, the reddish rock is speckled with little white spots with black rims. “They look like a tricolored leopard spot,” Stack Morgan says.Perseverance examined the spots with instruments that can identify their chemical contents and found that the rims contain iron phosphate molecules. On Earth, rings with similar texture and chemistry are associated with ancient microbial life. The chemical reactions that create the rings can be an energy source for microbes.“They don’t require life, of course, and that’s an important caveat,” Stack Morgan says. “But based on our experience with similar things on Earth, there is a possibility that life could have been involved, and these could have a biological origin.”The rock has other confusing features that muddy the picture of how it formed, Stack Morgan says. It is shot through with white veins of calcium sulfate. These veins are filled with millimeter-sized crystals of olivine, a mineral that forms from magma. The inclusion of both the spots and these volcanic features in the same rock is “a little bit mysterious,” Stack Morgan says, as they point to different origins. Figuring out how the rock formed could help tell how likely it is to have had the right conditions and temperatures to host biology.Planetary scientist Paul Byrne thinks we should be circumspect about the finding.“Could this truly be a biosignature? Yes. And if it is, then it really is the kind of society-altering discovery that the discovery of truly extraterrestrial life would be,” says Byrne, of Washington University in St. Louis. But it’s also possible that the spots came from something other than life, “in which case all this is is an interesting example of water-rock chemistry.”The only way to find out for sure is to bring the rock home. A big part of Perseverance’s mission is to collect samples from interesting rocks for a future spacecraft to return to Earth, where they can be studied in more sophisticated laboratories than a rover can carry on its back. Perseverance has thrown everything it has at this rock already, Stack Morgan says.But funding uncertainty has recently put the program, known as Mars Sample Return, on hold (SN: 5/8/24).“With this sample, the rationale for MSR is strengthened even more, and should I hope motivate NASA to commit to pulling off this project sooner rather than later,” Byrne says.Stack Morgan says the rover team is carrying on despite the budget uncertainty.“We have a mission to carry out, and a job to do: collecting compelling samples,” Stack Morgan says. “It can only be our hope that the samples that we collect are compelling enough to justify the cost of Mars Sample Return. I think with this exciting sample, that really hits that home.”Questions or comments on this article? E-mail us at feedback@sciencenews.org   Reprints FAQJPL-Caltech.

1|Sepsis tests take days  putting patients at risk. A new method may cut wait time|"Sepsis test could cut diagnosis time from days to minutes  Scientists say a new test for sepsis could cut diagnosis times from days to minutes.Detecting the deadly illness is difficult because the symptoms are nondescript.Current tests can take as long as 48 hours - problematic with an illness where every second counts.Peter Ghazal, from Cardiff University's Project Sepsis, said early detection ""dramatically improves"" chances of survival.""We're very excited. We think we can actually move this at least within five years, but hopefully before then, to actually being used in a clinical setting,"" he said.It is estimated five million people die every year from the illness worldwide, which occurs when the body responds to an infection by injuring its own tissues and organs.In Wales there are about 2,900 deaths annually.Nicola Madoc-Jones' daughter Edie developed sepsis after being born prematurely at 23 weeks.""They suspected she had sepsis so what they do is they take blood cultures, but unfortunately the results of the blood cultures take up to 48 hours,"" she said.""And we don't have those hours to spare.""Two-and-a-half years later, Edie is a strong toddler but between 30 and 40% of premature babies suffering from sepsis will not survive.The researchers have been trying to pick up signals in the blood from the ""chatter of the immune system"" to see if a patient is going to become sick.This is done by conducting ""millions"" of experiments on small volumes of blood. Researchers can then decipher signals from the chatter that indicate a patient is infected.""This is a chatter that occurs very early on, so days before the current tests actually give you any signal,"" Prof Ghazal said. ""This is something that can be used as a very early warning to pick up in terms of a clinical diagnosis for sepsis.""""The test that we're looking at could be done within minutes to hours from first suspecting a patient might be septic,"" he said.""If you don't detect sepsis in a patient, you can lose a life within hours, so the early recognition and the administration of antibiotics dramatically improves outcome in terms of survival.""Copyright 2024 BBC.

The experts made a surprising discovery during their investigation using a microcamera.They found that it was feasible to physically unseal and open the 2,000-year-old stone coffin, also known as a sarcophagus, which had remained untouched for centuries (Photo: Superintendence archaeology fine arts & landscape for the naples metropolitan area) In 2023, archaeologists made a remarkable discovery in Giugliano when they unearthed the perimeter of an ancient necropolis. This finding led them to uncover a structure that was later identified as the entrance to a chamber tomb, now known as the 'tomb of Cerberus.' Upon further investigation, the archaeologists were astounded by the presence of a captivating fresco within the tomb. The fresco showcased Cerberus, the legendary three-headed dog from ancient Greek mythology. (Photo: Superintendence archaeology fine arts & landscape for the Naples metropolitan area) Guigliano, a town situated in the Campania region of Italy, has a rich history dating back to ancient times. The area was settled by Greek colonizers during the period spanning the 8th and 7th centuries BC.Archaeologists from the Superintendency of Archaeology, Fine Arts, and Landscape made a startling discovery when they uncovered a tomb containing remarkably well-preserved bodies. The team was astonished not only by the condition of the remains but also by the unique preservation technique employed. The mummies, which have yet to be publicly showcased through images, were treated with a distinctive mixture of herbs. The ancient embalmers utilized a cream consisting of chenopodium, ""a genus of perennial herb colloquially known as goosefoot,"" and ""absinthium (wormwood)"" to preserve the bodies.

10|Wayanad's deadly landslides: Why climate change can not be ignored|"Climate change, extreme weather: What made Wayanad landslides so deadly  Listen to StoryKerala's Wayanad district has been struck by one of the most devastating landslides in recent memory, triggered by incessant monsoon rains. The tragedy, which unfolded in the early hours of July 30, 2024, has claimed over 150 lives and left many injured, with the death toll expected to rise further as rescue operations continue.  Indian Army and rescue forces are currently engaged in relief operations across the affected areas.       Wayanad: Rescue operation underway after a landslide triggered by heavy monsoon rains, in Wayanad district. (PTI Photo) Kerala, known for its high monsoon rainfall, receives an average of 3,107 mm of rain annually, with 75% occurring during the June-September monsoon season. The state's unique geography, bounded by the Arabian Sea to the west and the Western Ghats to the east, makes it particularly susceptible to heavy rains. However, experts argue that factors beyond meteorology, such as climate change and unplanned development, are exacerbating the situation.Dr. Akshay Deoras, Research Scientist at the University of Reading, UK, points out the stark contrast in rainfall patterns across Kerala this season. While some districts experienced above-average rainfall, others, including Wayanad, recorded below-average precipitation. This spatial variability, Dr. Deoras suggests, could intensify with continued global warming.       Wayanad: Rescue operation underway after a landslide triggered by heavy monsoon rains, in Wayanad district, Tuesday, July 30, 2024. At least 123 people were killed and dozens are still feared trapped in the accident. (PTI Photo) The state has witnessed a steady rise in extreme weather events over the past decade, including Cyclone Ockhi in 2017 and devastating floods in 2018 and 2019. According to the report ‘A review on the extreme rainfall studies in India,’ the frequency and intensity of extreme monsoon downpours in India have increased over the past 50 years, despite significant inter-annual variability. Trends indicate that extreme rainfall events are likely to continue increasing in the coming decades. Climate scientists attribute this trend to human-induced climate change, which has led to an increase in extreme rainfall events (EREs) associated with monsoons, thunderstorms, and localized cloudbursts.Mariam Zachariah, Research Associate at Imperial College London, explains that climate change is drastically altering Wayanad's rainfall patterns. The once cool, humid environment is now characterised by drier, hotter summers and intense monsoon downpours, increasing the risk of landslides. ""This change has increased the risk of landslides. Dry soils absorb less water and heavy rainfalls cause run-offs that can lead to landslides, such as the ones we've seen this week,” said Mariam Zachariah.Mahesh Palawat, Vice President of Meteorology and Climate Change at Skymet Weather, notes that monsoon patterns have become more erratic, with rains now resembling pre-monsoon characteristics. He attributes this change to rising air and ocean temperatures, particularly the rapid warming of the Arabian Sea, which pumps more moisture into the atmosphere.The role of unplanned development in exacerbating these climate-induced disasters cannot be overlooked. Professor Y P Sundriyal from HNB Garhwal University emphasised the need for scientifically sound construction techniques in mountainous regions, highlighting the current gap between planning and implementation.The Western Ghats, classified as an ecologically fragile region, have seen significant land-use changes. A recent study by the Indian Institute of Science divided the 1.6 lakh sq km of ghats into four ecologically sensitive regions, pointing to the need for careful development planning.       Wayanad: A damaged jeep at an affected area following landslides triggered by heavy rain at Chooralmala, in Wayanad district, Kerala, Tuesday, July 30, 2024. At least 90 people were killed and 128 injured, according to officials. (PTI Photo) Experts like Roxy Mathew Koll from the Indian Institute of Tropical Meteorology, Pune, call for improved early warning systems and careful evaluation of land use changes in landslide-prone areas. Prof Anjal Prakash from the Indian School of Business suggests implementing climate-resilient infrastructure and promoting sustainable land management practices to mitigate the impact of these disasters.Deforestation, rapid urbanisation, unplanned development, and poor planning are significant factors that are exacerbating the climate crisis in India. It is evident that development plans and human interference are not complementing the ecological balance of the mountainous terrain.The devastating landslides in Wayanad are a reminder of the critical importance of balancing development with environmental conservation, particularly in ecologically sensitive regions like the Western Ghats."|True|True
11|People born blind develop unique fingerprint-like pattern in the brain|"A beautiful mind: People born blind develop fingerprint-like pattern in the brain  Listen to StoryA new study led by Georgetown University neuroscientists has revealed that the brain in individuals born blind develops a unique connectivity pattern, similar to a fingerprint. This discovery, published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), has significant implications for understanding brain development and could pave the way for personalized rehabilitation and sight restoration strategies.For decades, researchers have known that the visual cortex in people born blind responds to various stimuli, including touch, smell, sound localisation, memory recall, and language. However, the lack of a common thread linking these tasks has puzzled scientists. The new study, led by postdoctoral researcher Dr. Lenia Amaral and Assistant Professor Dr. Ella Striem-Amit, offers a compelling explanation: individual differences in brain organization.""We don’t see this level of variation in the visual cortex connectivity among individuals who can see. The connectivity of the visual cortex is usually fairly consistent,"" said Dr. Striem-Amit, who leads the Sensory and Motor Plasticity Lab at Georgetown. ""The connectivity pattern in people born blind is more different across people, like an individual fingerprint, and is stable over time — so much so that the individual person can be identified from the connectivity pattern.""       Understanding each person’s connectivity may be crucial. (Photo: Getty) The study involved a small sample of individuals born blind who underwent repeated functional MRI scans over two years. Researchers used a neuroimaging technique to analyze neural connectivity across the brain. They found that the visual cortex in these individuals showed remarkable stability in its connectivity patterns over time, regardless of the task at hand.""Our study found that these patterns did not change significantly based on the task — whether participants were localizing sounds, identifying shapes, or simply resting. Instead, the connectivity patterns were unique to each individual and remained stable over the two-year study period,"" explained Dr. Amaral.Dr. Striem-Amit emphasized that these findings highlight the brain's plasticity and its ability to develop in diverse ways, especially in the absence of sight. ""Our findings suggest that experiences after birth shape the diverse ways our brains can develop. Brain plasticity in these cases frees the brain to develop, possibly even for different uses of the visual cortex among different people born blind,"" she said.The researchers propose that understanding each person’s individual connectivity may be crucial for tailoring rehabilitation and sight restoration solutions for individuals with blindness, based on their unique brain connectivity patterns.This study not only advances our understanding of brain development in the absence of sight but also opens new avenues for personalized medical interventions for the blind."|True|True
12|Asteroid on which Earth crashed a spacecraft had a mysterious origin|"Asteroid on which Earth crashed a spacecraft hides a mysterious origin story  Listen to StoryIn a groundbreaking planetary defense test in 2022, Nasa's Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft collided with the asteroid Dimorphos, providing scientists with high-resolution images of Dimorphos and its larger companion, Didymos. These images have enabled researchers to delve into the complex history of these near-Earth objects and gain new insights into the formation of binary asteroid systems—where a primary asteroid is orbited by a secondary moonlet.The analysis of the craters and surface strength on Didymos suggests it formed approximately 12.5 million years ago, likely originating from the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter before being knocked into the inner solar system.        This mission has significantly advanced our understanding of binary asteroid systems. (Photo: Nasa) Dimorphos, on the other hand, is much younger, forming around 300,000 years ago. This younger asteroid is believed to have been created from material ejected from Didymos due to its rapid rotation, influenced by the YORP effect, which is driven by sunlight impacting its uneven surface.Astronomer Maurizio Pajola from the National Institute for Astrophysics (INAF) in Italy, lead author of one of five studies published in Nature Communications, explained that both Didymos and Dimorphos are aggregates of rocky fragments resulting from the catastrophic destruction of a parent asteroid. The presence of large boulders on both asteroids supports this theory, as such boulders could not have formed from impacts on their surfaces alone.Didymos, with a diameter of about 780 meters, and Dimorphos, about 170 meters wide, are classified as ""rubble pile"" asteroids. Their surfaces are covered with boulders, with the largest on Dimorphos being the size of a school bus and the largest on Didymos as big as a soccer field. Planetary geologist Olivier Barnouin from Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory noted that the surfaces of both asteroids are weak, much weaker than loose sand.The DART mission's impact on Dimorphos at 14,000 miles per hour successfully altered its orbit around Didymos, demonstrating the potential of kinetic force to change the path of a space object. This mission has significantly advanced our understanding of binary asteroid systems, which make up about 10-15% of near-Earth asteroids. The data collected will aid in future planetary defense strategies and enhance our knowledge of asteroid formation and evolution.The findings from the DART mission point to the complexity of asteroid systems and the importance of continued observation and study. As Olivier Barnouin remarked, each new observation helps scientists learn more about the intricate processes that shape these celestial bodies, providing critical information for both planetary defense and our broader understanding of the solar system's history."|True|True
13|Scientists mind-control mice in world's first experiment|"Scientists use magnetism to mind-control mice in world's first experiment  Listen to StoryIn a world-first experiment, researchers at the Center for Nanomedicine within the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) and Yonsei University in South Korea have successfully demonstrated the ability to control specific brain regions in mice using magnetic fields. This breakthrough, known as Nano-MIND (Magnetogenetic Interface for NeuroDynamics) technology, opens up new possibilities for understanding and manipulating complex brain functions such as cognition, emotion, and motivation.The Nano-MIND technology allows for wireless, remote, and precise modulation of specific deep brain neural circuits using magnetism. This innovative approach leverages magnetic fields and magnetized nanoparticles to selectively activate targeted brain circuits, offering a significant advancement over existing methods of brain manipulation.       Overview of nano-MIND technology - regulation of higher-order brain functions through selective control of specific neurons and brain circuits. (Photo: IBS) In their experiments, the research team demonstrated the technology's capabilities by activating specific neurons in different brain regions of mice. One notable achievement was the activation of inhibitory GABA receptors in the medial preoptic area (MPOA), which is responsible for maternal behaviours. When these neurons were stimulated in non-maternal female mice, the animals exhibited significantly increased nurturing behaviours, mimicking those of maternal mice.The researchers also successfully regulated feeding behaviours by targeting motivation circuits in the lateral hypothalamus. Activation of inhibitory neurons in this area resulted in a remarkable 100% increase in appetite and feeding behaviours in mice. Conversely, when excitatory neurons were activated, the mice showed a more than 50% reduction in appetite and feeding behaviours.       The findings could be widely used in research to understand brain functions. (Photo: Getty) Dr. CHEON Jinwoo, Director of the Center for Nanomedicine, expressed enthusiasm about the potential applications of this technology: ""This is the world's first technology to freely control specific brain regions using magnetic fields. We expect it to be widely used in research to understand brain functions, sophisticated artificial neural networks, two-way BCI technologies, and new treatments for neurological disorders.""The Nano-MIND technology represents a significant step forward in neuroscience research and could have far-reaching implications for the development of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) and the treatment of neurological disorders. By allowing researchers to selectively activate desired brain circuits and bidirectionally modulate higher brain functions, this technology paves the way for more precise and less invasive methods of studying and potentially treating various brain-related conditions.As research in this field continues to advance, it is likely that we will see further developments in our understanding of the brain's complex functions and new therapeutic approaches for neurological disorders."|True|True
14|Nisar  the joint Nasa-Isro mission  won't launch in 2024|Nasa finishing work on Nisar mission but Isro can't launch it till February 2025  Listen to StoryNasa's work on the radar antenna reflector for the Nasa-Isro Synthetic Aperture Radar (Nisar) satellite is nearing completion in California. The American space agency said that the testing is currently underway to ensure that this critical hardware component will deploy correctly following its launch from India. Nisar mission represents a significant collaboration between Nasa and Isro, combining the expertise and resources of both organizations to advance our understanding of Earth's dynamic systems. The drum-shaped reflector, measuring about 39 feet (12 meters) across, is one of Nasa’s key contributions to this joint mission with the Indian Space Research Organisation (Isro).The reflector is designed to transmit and receive microwave signals to and from Earth's surface, enabling Nisar to scan nearly all the planet’s land and ice surfaces twice every 12 days to gather essential scientific data.        The reflector will be reintegrated with the radar system by teams from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory. (Photo: Nasa) This capability will provide valuable insights into various Earth processes, including ecosystem disturbances, ice-sheet collapse, and natural hazards such as earthquakes, tsunamis, and landslides.In March, the reflector was transported back from India to a specialised facility in California. There, reflective tape was applied, and other precautionary measures were taken to mitigate temperature increases that could potentially affect the deployment of the reflector from its stowed configuration before beginning science operations.After the successful completion of testing, Nasa plans to transport the reflector to an Isro facility in Bengaluru, India. At this facility, the reflector will be reintegrated with the radar system by teams from Nasa’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and Isro. During this period, a launch readiness date will be determined by Isro in coordination with Nasa.However, it is important to note that the Nisar launch cannot occur between early October 2024 and early February 2025. Nasa said that launching during this window would subject the satellite to periods of alternating sunlight and shadows due to the Sun's position, causing temperature fluctuations that could affect the deployment of Nisar’s boom and radar antenna reflector.Once operational, Nisar will provide unprecedented data to help scientists monitor and respond to environmental changes and natural disasters, ultimately contributing to global efforts in climate science and disaster management.|False|True
15|July 21  2024 was the hottest day on Earth  record broken on July 22|"July 21, 2024 was the hottest day on Earth. The record was broken on July 22  Listen to StoryOn July 22, 2024, Earth experienced its hottest day on record, with the global average temperature reaching a staggering 17.15°C, according to NASA's analysis of global daily temperature data. This new record surpassed the previous high of 17.09°C set just a day earlier on July 21. July 23 also exceeded the previous record, highlighting a concerning trend of escalating global temperatures.These unprecedented temperatures are part of a long-term warming trend driven by human activities, primarily the emission of greenhouse gases. NASA's extensive data collection and analysis capabilities have been crucial in monitoring these changes. ""In a year that has been the hottest on record to date, these past two weeks have been particularly brutal,"" said NASA Administrator Bill Nelson. ""Through our over two dozen Earth-observing satellites and over 60 years of data, NASA is providing critical analyses of how our planet is changing and how local communities can prepare, adapt, and stay safe.""       Daily global average temperature values from MERRA-2 for the years 1980-2022 are shown in white, values for the year 2023 are shown in pink, and values from 2024 through June are shown in red. (Photo: Nasa) The preliminary findings come from data analyses using the Modern-Era Retrospective analysis for Research and Applications, Version 2 (MERRA-2), and the Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing (GEOS-FP) systems. These systems combine millions of global observations from land, sea, air, and satellite instruments using atmospheric models. GEOS-FP provides rapid, near-real-time weather data, while MERRA-2 ensures the use of the highest quality observations.The daily global average temperature values from MERRA-2 for the years 1980-2022 are shown in white, values for 2023 in pink, and values from 2024 through June in red. The daily global temperature values from July 1 to 23, 2024, from GEOS-FP are shown in purple. These results align with an independent analysis from the European Union's Copernicus Earth Observation Programme, both indicating a significant increase in global temperatures.       People crowd a public beach during a hot day amid a heatwave, in the Mediterranean city of Alexandria. (Photo: Reuters) The latest records follow 13 consecutive months of monthly temperature records, according to scientists from NASA's Goddard Institute for Space Studies in New York. Their analysis, based on the GISTEMP record, uses surface instrumental data to provide a long-term view of global temperature changes at monthly and annual resolutions dating back to the late 19th century.The rising temperatures point to the urgent need for global action to mitigate climate change. As the planet continues to warm, it is anticipated that temperature records will continue to be broken, highlighting the critical importance of reducing greenhouse gas emissions and implementing sustainable practices to protect our planet."|True|True

This finding, led by researchers from Cardiff University, challenges the widely accepted timeline that animals first emerged around 635 million years ago.The team discovered evidence of a much earlier ecosystem in the Franceville Basin near Gabon on the Atlantic coast of Central Africa, dating back over 1.5 billion years earlier than previously thought. Their study, published in Precambrian Research, describes a unique episode of underwater volcanic activity following the collision of two continents, creating a nutrient-rich environment conducive to early biological evolution.Dr. Ernest Chi Fru, the lead author and a Reader at Cardiff University’s School of Earth and Environmental Sciences, highlighted the significance of phosphorus availability in the environment as a key component in the evolution of life. ""The availability of phosphorus in the environment is thought to be a key component in the evolution of life on Earth, especially in the transition from simple single-cell organisms to complex organisms like animals and plants,"" Dr. Chi Fru explained.The Cardiff-led team identified a link between environmental change and nutrient enrichment, which may have triggered the evolution of large-sized fossils of macroorganisms from this period. These fossils, the earliest of their kind in the geologic record, have been a subject of debate among scientists.Geochemical analysis of marine sedimentary rocks deposited 2.1 billion years ago provided new insights into these large fossils. Dr. Chi Fru elaborated, ""We think that the underwater volcanoes, which followed the collision and suturing of the Congo and S£o Francisco cratons into one main body, further restricted and even cut off this section of water from the global ocean to create a nutrient-rich shallow marine inland sea.""This isolated environment allowed cyanobacterial photosynthesis to thrive, leading to the oxygenation of local seawater and the generation of a substantial food resource. This, in turn, provided sufficient energy to promote an increase in body size and more complex behavior in primitive animal-like life forms.However, the restricted nature of this water mass and the hostile conditions beyond it likely prevented these early life forms from spreading globally. The study suggests a two-step evolution of complex life on Earth: the first major rise in atmospheric oxygen content 2.1 billion years ago, followed by a second rise 1.5 billion years later.This discovery not only pushes back the timeline for the emergence of complex life but also provides crucial insights into the environmental conditions that facilitated this significant evolutionary leap."|True|True
17|A secret Chinese plane is flying in space. No one knows what it does|"A secret Chinese plane is flying in space. No one knows what it does  Listen to StoryChina's shadowy, uncrewed reusable spacecraft, which launches atop a rocket booster and lands at a secretive military airfield, is most likely testing technology but could also be used for manipulating or retrieving satellites, experts say.The spacecraft, on its third mission, was in June observed releasing an object, moving several kilometres away and then manoeuvring back to within a few hundred metres of it.""It's obvious that it has a military application, including, for example, closely inspecting objects of the enemy or disabling them,"" said Marco Langbroek, a lecturer in optical space situational awareness at Delft University of Technology in the Netherlands.""But it also has non-military applications. Gaining experience with this kind of grab and release is good if you want to for instance ... refuel your own satellites.""As militaries worldwide develop complex satellite networks, a reusable spacecraft that can interfere with them could have immense value, Langbroek and three other experts said.China has never disclosed what technologies the spacecraft has tested, nor has the spaceplane been publicly photographed since it began operating. The U.S. first launched its uncrewed Boeing (BA.N), opens new tab X-37B spaceplane in 2010, while Russia has recently launched several satellites that U.S. officials suspect may be weapons, a charge Russia has denied.China's spaceplane is most likely testing technology, much like the X-37B, said Victoria Samson, chief director of space security and stability at  the Secure World Foundation thinktank in Washington, D.C.""I don't think that either has a whole lot of military utility, to be honest,"" Samson said. ""I am guessing that both are technology demonstrators."" China's ministry of defence did not immediately respond to a request for comment. State media outlet Xinhua has noted the launches and landings of the spaceplane, which it refers to as a ""reusable test spacecraft"".The current flight of the Chinese spaceplane began in December 2023. The previous mission, which also involved putting a separate object in space and retrieving it, launched in August 2022 and lasted 276 days, according to tracking data. Its first flight was in September 2020 and lasted two days.""We see breathtaking advancements by the People's Republic of China in space,"" said General Stephen Whiting, commander of U.S. Space Command, noting that his organisation did not know what objects the spaceplane had released.""Any space activity that they undertake, we assume has some dual use in the national security realm,"" Whiting said. ""We're always interested in understanding what could that dual use be, and trying to make sure that we have a good knowledge of that.""Little is known about China's spaceplane.Tracking data show it launches from Jiuquan, in north central China, and lands at an airfield in Lop Nur, in the country's Xinjiang region. The airfield is linked to a site once used for nuclear testing and is tightly controlled by the military, said Jonathan McDowell of the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics.Data show it has changed its altitude from common orbits of roughly 350 kms (217 miles) to 600 kms and back, he said.It is thought to be roughly the same size and shape as the X-37B, which is about 30 feet (9.14 m) long and has spent as long as 908 days in orbit at altitudes of up to 38,000 km.Given it has spent months in space, China's spaceplane is also assumed to be uncrewed, although it has flown atop China's only human-rated booster, the Long March 2F.The U.S. Space Shuttle, which operated from 1981 to 2011, was about the size of a 737 airliner and could carry a crew of seven but spent no longer than 17 days in orbit. The Soviet Union developed a large crewed spaceplane called Buran, which made one automated orbital flight, a 3-hour journey in 1988.The Space Shuttle performed 10 classified missions out of 135 flights, leading the Soviet Union to consider it a military spaceplane and develop Buran, said Jeffrey Lewis, director of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Center for Nonproliferation Studies.""We don't want to look at this (Chinese) spaceplane the same way the Soviets looked at the Shuttle,"" he said. ""A lot of these are just experiments rather than well-thought-out military platforms.""The apparent experiments in orbit with releasing and retrieving objects mirror those of the United States' X-37B.The X-37B's missions have all been classified, but are described as taking experiments to space and back, and exploring ""reusable vehicle technologies that support long-term space objectives"", according to Boeing.How well those experiments go could influence the duration of the mission. Testing a cutting-edge sensor, for instance, could yield intelligence so useful that the government may want to keep it in space for longer before bringing it back to the lab, McDowell said.Inspecting or disabling an adversary's satellites is another potential military capability. Some countries, including the U.S., China, India and Russia, already have ground-based anti-satellite missiles.       China in 2021 test flew a hypersonic glide vehicle. (Photo: AFP) Orbital weapons have long been taboo, and weapons of mass destruction in space are banned by the 1967 Outer Space Treaty.China in 2021 test flew a hypersonic glide vehicle as part of a Cold War-era concept known as a fractional orbital bombardment system, which launches a warhead partially into orbit, allowing it to strike with little warning from unusual trajectories.But attacking from orbit using a spaceplane offers little advantage over ballistic missiles or cruise missiles, Lewis said.Two senior Indian military officers, speaking on condition of anonymity as they were not authorised to speak to the media, said that although the exact purpose of the Chinese spaceplane was unclear, India was concerned.""The spacecraft in question is definitely alarming,"" said one of the officers. ""Things like this can always have dual purposes. India is keenly watching."""|True|True
18|Discovery in Ladakh could forever change search for alien life Ladakh's harsh climate  characterised by high UV radiation  extreme temperature fluctuations  and limited water availability  makes it an ideal terrestrial analogue for Martian conditions.|"Discovery in Ladakh could forever change search for alien life  Listen to StoryScientists have made a new discovery in Ladakh that could revolutionise the search for extraterrestrial life. Researchers from the Birbal Sahni Institute of Palaeosciences (BSIP) have identified magnetofossils - fossil remains of magnetic particles produced by magnetotactic bacteria - in rock varnish layers in the region known as India's ""cold desert.""This finding, published in Planetary and Space Science, suggests that biotic processes play a crucial role in the formation of rock varnish, demonstrating how life can thrive in extreme environments. Rock varnish, a dark-coloured natural coating rich in manganese, iron, and clay minerals, forms on rock surfaces and fractures in extremely dry and cold environments, and is believed to provide nutritional support to microbiota.Ladakh's harsh climate, characterised by high UV radiation, extreme temperature fluctuations, and limited water availability, makes it an ideal terrestrial analogue for Martian conditions.Dr. Amritpal Singh Chaddha and Dr. Anupam Sharma, lead researchers at BSIP, analyzed rock varnish samples from Ladakh using X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Their analysis revealed nanochains of magnetofossils and higher concentrations of oxidized manganese and carboxylic acid, indicating organic signatures.The similarity between Ladakh's rock varnish and that observed on Mars during Nasa's Perseverance rover operations inspired this research. The study's findings highlight the potential of rock varnish as an archive of ancient environmental records and a valuable resource for astrobiological studies.This discovery has significant implications for future space exploration. By identifying biotic signatures in rock varnish, scientists can better target potential biosignatures on Mars and other celestial bodies, enhancing the search for extraterrestrial life. The research provides crucial insights for planning future missions by space agencies like Isro, particularly in Mars exploration where identifying habitable environments is a primary objective.As we continue to explore the possibilities of life beyond Earth, studies like this from Ladakh serve as stepping stones, bridging our understanding of extreme terrestrial environments with the potential for life in the cosmos."|True|True

The Atomic Minerals Directorate for Exploration and Research (AMD), a unit of the Department of Atomic Energy, has identified 1,600 tonnes of lithium resources in the Marlagalla area of Mandya district through preliminary surveys and limited subsurface exploration.Dr. Singh shared this information in a written reply to an unstarred question in the Rajya Sabha. He emphasized that AMD is actively exploring potential geological domains for lithium in other parts of India, including Korba District in Chhattisgarh. Additionally, major mica belts in Rajasthan, Bihar, and Andhra Pradesh, as well as pegmatite belts in Odisha, Chhattisgarh, and Karnataka, are being investigated for their lithium potential.       Lithium, which is an element on the periodic table, is one of the most sought-after minerals globally. (Photo: Getty) Lithium, which is an element on the periodic table, is one of the most sought-after minerals globally. The element was first discovered in 1817 by Johan August Arfvedson and the word lithium comes from lithos in Greek, which means stone. The metal with the lowest density, lithium, reacts vigorously with water and is toxic in nature.In a related development, AMD's preliminary survey in Himachal Pradesh has led to the identification of surface uranium occurrences in Masanbal, Hamirpur district. However, Dr. Singh clarified that the Atomic Energy Commission has not conducted any studies to establish an atomic energy plant in Himachal Pradesh.Dr. Singh also addressed the Department of Atomic Energy's (DAE) interest in small modular reactors (SMRs). While the DAE is studying various technologies and designs of SMRs from different countries and foreign vendors, there are no current proposals to collaborate with foreign entities. Furthermore, no private players have shown interest in producing SMRs, although some have expressed interest in deploying small reactors at their captive sites.Highlighting international cooperation, Dr. Singh noted that the Government of India and the Government of the Russian Federation have expressed mutual interest in expanding cooperation in the peaceful use of nuclear energy, including in the field of SMRs.|True|True

21|Butchered animal bones indicate earliest human presence in southern South America|Feedback   Thursday, August 15, 2024 					18/07/24   4:40 pm			 													   Argentina    Armadillo    Fossil bones    Glyptodonts    Ice Age    Neosclerocalyptus Fossil bones found in Argentina of a large armadillo relative with cut marks suggestive of butchering indicate humans were present in southern South America some 21,000 years ago, according to researchers, earlier than previously thought.The bones were from a large armored plant-eating mammal named Neosclerocalyptus, part of a group called glyptodonts that inhabited the Americas for more than 30 million years before going extinct at the end of the Ice Age about 10,000 years ago.The researchers said the cut marks on the bones appear to have been made by people using stone tools. That represents strong evidence for the presence of our species, Homo sapiens, though no human fossils were found at the site, they added.Glyptodonts are related to modern-day armadillos, though much larger – some species as big as a small car. They had a large, bony carapace that covered much of the body – resembling a turtle shell – as well as armor atop the head, a large and strongly built tail and short limbs.Neosclerocalyptus was one of the smaller species. The individual in this study was about 6 feet long (180 cm) and roughly 660 pounds (300 kilograms).The marks on the bones were found on the pelvis, tail and body armor.“The placement of these cut marks is consistent with a butchering sequence that targets areas of dense flesh, that is, the cut marks were not randomly distributed but focused on those skeletal elements that harbored large muscle packs like the pelvis and the tail. This is a typical pattern observed during a butchering process,” said anthropologist Miguel Delgado of National University of La Plata, senior author of the study published on Wednesday in the journal PLOS ONE.The shapes of the cut marks are consistent with those created using types of stone tools called flakes and hammerstones, Delgado added.Anthropologist and study lead author Mariano del Papa of National University of La Plata said that “the only ones capable of making them (these marks) were humans.”The timeline for the peopling of the Americas has been a matter of debate, with some recent discoveries indicating humans had arrived much earlier than previously thought. The role of people in the extinction of many large mammals in the Americas also has been a subject of controversy. The Neosclerocalyptus fossils are among the oldest evidence of human interaction with these large Ice Age animals.The new findings represent the oldest evidence of both the presence of Homo sapiens and human interaction with large animals in southern South America during the height of the last Ice Age, a time known as the Last Glacial Maximum, and one of the oldest in all of South America, the researchers said.“Until recently, the traditional model suggested that modern humans (Homo sapiens) entered the Americas 16,000 years ago, so most of the archaeological evidence was framed during that period. Since a few years ago, new evidence has been found indicating an earlier human presence,” Delgado said.“Currently, we know that in South America reliable evidence was recovered in Brazil from 23,000 years ago, but it’s worth noting that contemporaneous sites were found in North America with material dated between 21,000 and 23,000 years ago, and even earlier sites were also found in Central America dated between 26,000 and 19,000 years ago,” Delgado added.The Neosclerocalyptus fossils were unearthed in 2015 from the banks of the Reconquista River near the town of Merlo in the Buenos Aires metropolitan area, dating to the Pleistocene epoch. A method called radiocarbon dating determined that the fossils were about 21,000 years old.National University of La Plata paleontologist and study co-author Martin de Los Reyes said, “This would be the first evidence of humans in Argentina and the Southern Cone of South America.”“We are shifting the traditional paradigm that speaks of a specific moment of human arrival in the Americas,” Delgado added.(Reuters)05/06/24   9:19 am03/11/23   2:08 pm23/11/23   2:57 pm05/06/24   8:38 am29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pm29/11/23   2:51 pmWe will send you breaking news right to your inbox|True|True

Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad explored the enzyme’s suitability for therapeutic applications.   Photo Credit: V. Praveen Kumar, LVPEI Scientists from the CSIR-Institute of Genomics and Integrative Biology, New Delhi, have developed an enhanced genome-editing system that can modify DNA more precisely and more efficiently than existing CRISPR-based technologies.CRISPR occurs naturally in some bacteria, as a part of their immune system that limits infections by recognising and destroying viral DNA. In Nobel-prize winning work, scientists repurposed this bacterial defence mechanism to develop a novel approach for editing the genomes of higher-order organisms.Today, using CRISPR-Cas9, researchers can add, remove or alter specific DNA sequences in the genome of animals. This system has been used in various fields, including in agriculture — to improve the nutritional value of plants and increase the yield — and in healthcare to diagnose several diseases and treat genetic disorders.The CRISPR-Cas9 gene editing tool uses a guide-RNA (gRNA) designed to find and bind to a specific part of the target genome. The gRNA directs an enzyme, Cas9, to the target site, which is followed by a short DNA sequence called protospacer adjacent motif (PAM). Cas9 recognises and binds to the PAM sequence, and acts as a molecular scissor that snips some damaged DNA. This automatically triggers the cell’s DNA repair system, which repairs the snipped part to insert the correct DNA sequence.But the CRISPR-Cas9 system can also recognise and cut parts of the genome other than the intended portion. Such “off-target” effects are more common when using the SpCas9 enzyme derived from Streptococcus pyogenes bacteria. Scientists have been able to engineer versions of SpCas9 with higher fidelity but only at the cost of editing efficiency.To overcome these issues, researchers are exploring Cas9 enzymes from Francisella novicida bacteria. While this Cas9, called FnCas9, is highly precise, it has a low efficiency as well.To enhance it without compromising its specificity, researchers led by Debojyoti Chakraborty and Souvik Maiti at CSIR-IGIB modified and engineered new versions of FnCas9.The researchers tinkered with amino acids in FnCas9 that recognise and interact with the PAM sequence on the host genome. “By doing this, we increase the binding affinity of the Cas protein with the PAM sequence,” Dr. Chakraborty said. “The Cas9 can then sit on the DNA in a stronger configuration, and your gene editing becomes much more effective.”The researchers also engineered the enhanced FnCas9 to be more flexible and edit regions of the genome that are otherwise harder to access. “This opens up more avenues for gene editing,” Dr. Chakraborty said.Experiments to measure enzyme activity showed that enhanced FnCas9 cut target DNA at a higher rate compared to unmodified FnCas9.CRISPR-based tools for diagnostics and therapeutics rely on the ability of the system to recognise specific single-nucleotide changes in the DNA. Nucleotides are the building blocks of DNA and RNA. Each nucleotide consists of a nucleobase, a phosphate group, and a sugar. Each nucleotide in DNA has one of four nucleobases: adenosine, thymine, guanine, and cytosine. A single-nucleotide change is when just one nucleotide in the genome needs to be ‘repaired’.When the researchers tested the ability of enhanced FnCas9 to identify such changes in the genome, they found enFnCas9 outperformed unmodified FnCas9. An enhanced FnCas9-based diagnostic could target almost twice the number of changes compared to FnCas9, increasing the scope of detecting more disease-causing genetic changes.Once Dr. Chakraborty’s team had shown the increased efficiency and activity of the enhanced FnCas9 enzyme, a team led by Indumathi Mariappan at the L.V. Prasad Eye Institute in Hyderabad explored the enzyme’s suitability for therapeutic applications.The researchers used enhanced FnCas9 to edit the genome of human kidney and eye cells grown in lab dishes. It not only edited genes in these cells at a better rate than did SpCas9, it also showed negligible off-target effects.The team finally sought to understand whether enhanced FnCas9 is a viable option for treating genetic disorders. They tested the enzyme’s efficiency at correcting a genetic mutation that causes Leber congenital amaurosis type 2 (LCA2), a form of inherited blindness. A single mutation in the RPE65 gene results in the loss of expression of a protein called retinal pigment epithelial-specific (RPE65), resulting in severe vision loss.The team isolated skin cells from an individual with LCA2 carrying the RPE65 mutation, and reprogrammed these cells to become induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs). Such cells can be made to grow into any cell type in the human body. When the researchers differentiated the iPSCs into cells of the eye’s retina, the cells expressed negligible levels of RPE65 protein.The researchers delivered a CRISPR system with the enhanced FnCas9 enzyme into the individual’s iPSCs to correct the mutation responsible for low levels of this protein. When they sequenced the edited cells, they found that the CRISPR tool had corrected the mutation. The edited iPSCs when differentiated into retinal cells also showed normal levels of the RPE65 protein.Dr. Mariappan said the team was taken aback by the efficiency of the editing. Most of the iPSCs carried the edits, and when the researchers grew colonies from individual edited iPSCs, they found that two colonies showed 100% mutation correction.“We also examined the whole genome for off-target interactions and found only a few, of no major concern, as compared to several hits seen with other Cas9 proteins [we] examined,” she added.Previous reports have suggested that such person-specific retinal cells can be transplanted back into a person to treat inherited blindness conditions like LCA2.A group of U.S. researchers reported on May 6, 2024, in the New England Journal of Medicine that CRISPR injected directly into the eyes of people suffering from LCA2 has shown success in early clinical trials. But editing patient-specific stem cells and transplanting the mutation-corrected cells into patients is a safer option, according to Dr. Mariappan, “because this allows us to screen and confirm precise edits.”“The research community needed this precision” in the CRISPR system, Shailja Singh, a researcher at Jawaharlal Nehru University, New Delhi, who uses CRISPR-based tools to model and study genetic diseases like sickle cell anaemia and β-thalassaemia, said. Such reduced off-target effects are critical for those who use CRISPR-based therapy to correct mutations, “so this is a very welcome approach.”Dr. Singh added that while a precise enzyme without any off-target effects is much-needed, the delivery system must also be equally proficient. According to her, researchers should next focus on precisely delivering this tool into the nuclei of the target cells.Dr. Chakraborty said the team is working on adapting the system to different delivery methods as well as reducing the size of the enFnCas9. “All these will come in the following studies,” he said.The team is also in contact with some Indian companies to scale up and manufacture therapeutic solutions for multiple genetic disorders . “This opens up the doors for not licensing from a foreign entity, which could be very, very expensive.”Dr. Mariappan agreed: “With indigenous intellectual property for such a high precision editor, we are now in a better position to develop newer therapeutics at affordable costs for people in low- and middle-income countries like ours.”Sneha Khedkar is a biologist turned freelance science journalist. genetics  Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

24|Human DNA will have to be edited if humans are to settle on other planets|Human DNA will have to be edited if humans are to settle on other planets   To enjoy additional benefitsCONNECT WITH US Published - July 27, 2024 01:33 pm IST  The potential applications of gene editing for allowing us to travel further are almost limitless. Representative image.   Photo Credit: Nicolas Lobos/Unsplash When considering human settlements on the Moon, Mars and further afield, much attention is given to the travel times, food and radiation risk. We’ll undoubtedly face a harsh environment in deep space and some thinkers have been pointing to genome editing as a way to ensure that humans can tolerate the severe conditions as they venture further into the solar system.In January, I was fortunate to attend a much-anticipated debate between astronomer royal Martin Rees and Mars exploration advocate Dr Robert Zubrin. The event at the British Interplanetary Society took on the topic of whether the exploration of Mars should be human or robotic. In a recent book called ‘The End of Astronauts’, Rees and co-author Donald Goldsmith outline the benefits of exploration of the solar system using robotic spacecraft and vehicles, without the expense and risk of sending humans along for the ride. Dr Zubrin supports human exploration. Where there was some agreement was over Rees’s advocacy of using gene editing technology to enable humans to overcome the immense challenges of becoming an interplanetary species.Our genome is all the DNA present in our cells. Since 2011, we have been able to easily and accurately edit genomes. First came a molecular tool called Crispr-Cas9, which today can be used in a high school lab for very little cost and has even been used on the International Space Station. Then came techniques called base and prime editing, through which miniscule changes can be made in the genome of any living organism. The potential applications of gene editing for allowing us to travel further are almost limitless. One of the most problematic hazards astronauts will encounter in deep space is a higher dosage of radiation, which can cause havoc with many processes in the body and increase the longer-term risk of cancer.Perhaps, using genome editing, we could insert genes into humans from plants and bacteria that are able to clean up radiation in the event of radioactive waste spills and nuclear fallout. It sounds like science fiction, but eminent thinkers such as Rees believe this is key to our advancement across the solar system.Identifying and then inserting genes into humans that slow down aging and counter cellular breakdown could also help. We could also engineer crops that resist the effects of exposure to radioactivity as crews will need to grow their own food. We could also personalise medicine to an astronaut’s needs based on their particular genetic makeup.Imagine a future where the human genome is so well understood it has become pliable under this new, personalised medicine.Tardigrades are microscopic animals sometimes referred to as “water bears”. Experiments have shown that these tiny creatures can tolerate extreme temperatures, pressures, high radiation and starvation. They can even tolerate the vacuum of space. Geneticists are eager to understand their genomes and a paper published in Nature sought to uncover the key genes and proteins that give the miniature creatures this extraordinary stress tolerance. If we could insert some of the genes involved into crops, could we make them tolerant to the highest levels of radiation and environmental stress? It’s worth exploring. Even more intriguing is whether inserting tardigrade genes into our own genome could make us more resilient to the harsh conditions in space. Scientists have already shown that human cells in the lab developed increased tolerance to X-ray radiation when tardigrade genes were inserted into them. Transferring genes from tardigrades is just one speculative example of how we might be able engineer humans and crops to be more suited to space travel.We’ll need much more research if scientists are ever to get to this stage. However, in the past, several governments have been keen to enforce tight restrictions on how genome editing is used, as well as on other technologies for inserting genes from one species into another. Germany and Canada are among the most cautious, but elsewhere restrictions seem to be relaxing. In November 2018, the Chinese scientist He Jiankui announced that he had created the first gene edited babies. He had introduced a gene into the unborn twins that confers resistance to HIV infection. The scientist was subsequently jailed. But he has since been released and allowed to carry out research again. In the new space race, certain countries may go to lengths with genome editing that other nations, especially in the west where restrictions are already tight, may not. Whoever wins would reap enormous scientific and economic benefits.If Rees and the other futurists are right, this field has the potential to advance our expansion into the cosmos. But society will need to agree to it. It’s likely there will be opposition, because of the deep-seated fears of altering the human species forever. And with base and prime editing now having advanced the precision of targeted gene editing, it’s clear that the technology is moving faster than the conversation.One country or another is likely to take the leap where others pull back from the brink. Only then will we find out just how viable these ideas really are. Until then, we can only speculate with curiosity, and perhaps excitement too.Sam McKee is associate tutor and a PhD candidate in the philosophy of science, Manchester Metropolitan University.

Photo Credit: ROV-Team/GEOMAR An unknown process is producing oxygen deep in the world’s oceans, where it is too dark for photosynthesis, scientists reported on July 22 in the journal Nature Geoscience. The finding has important implications because oxygen helps support life and the discovery implies the existence of previously unknown ecosystems.Many governments are also bound to take notice since one explanation for the oxygen is that polymetallic nodules are transporting electric charges that split water molecules around them, releasing oxygen. Polymetallic nodules are lumps of iron, manganese hydroxides, and rock partially submerged in many parts of the ocean floor. If their concentration exceeds 10 kg per sq. m, mining them is considered to be economically feasible — and many countries are planning to do so as a new resource.On July 22, Reuters reported an unnamed “top government scientist” saying India is planning to “apply for licences to explore for deep-sea minerals in the Pacific Ocean”. India’s Ministry of Earth Sciences is also currently building a submersible vehicle that will look for and mine similar resources in the Indian Ocean as part of its ‘Deep Ocean Mission’. The oxygen discovery raises questions about how deep-sea mining to extract polymetallic nodules will affect marine ecosystems.The scientists behind the study, from Germany, the U.K., and the U.S., were studying the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, a part of the ocean floor off Mexico’s west coast. Covering an area larger than India, the Zone is considered to have the world’s highest concentration of polymetallic nodules, including 6 billion tonnes of manganese and more than 200 million tonnes each of copper and nickel.When the scientists were conducting experiments at a depth of 4 km, they noticed the oxygen concentration in some places rapidly increased instead of decreasing. They conducted follow-up studies in 2020 and 2021. In each case, they released a device from the surface that would land on the ocean floor, where it would isolate a small volume of the floor along with some sea water and measure the oxygen levels.This underwater region is called the abyssal zone. It receives too little sunlight for photosynthesis to be feasible. Instead, life-forms here get oxygen from water carried in by a global circulation called the ‘Great Conveyor Belt’. Still, the amount of oxygen is low and without any local production, the device should have measured the oxygen levels dropping as small animals consumed it. But the scientists found the opposite: it increased, sometimes tripling in just two days.They double-checked the finding by recreating the conditions on the ocean floor in their lab, and found the oxygen levels to increase up to a point before dropping.When they measured the physical characteristics of the nodules, they found their surfaces to have a voltage of up to 0.95 V. Splitting one water molecule requires 1.5 V, but the researchers have suspected the voltage could build up if many nodules are close together, like the cells of a battery.Andrew Sweetman, an ecologist with the Scottish Association for Marine Science in the U.K. and a coauthor of the study, told Nature, “We have another source of oxygen on the planet, other than photosynthesis.” His team is calling it ‘dark oxygen’.Oxygen sources are valuable because they allow life to survive. But as the lab experiment indicated, the nodules could only produce oxygen as long as they could muster a sufficient voltage. The nodules’ own energy source is also not clear.Given the quantity of metals polymetallic nodules on the ocean floor hold, deep-sea mining is expected to be a major marine resource extraction activity in the coming decades. The International Seabed Authority has established 15-year contracts with at least 22 contractors — including the Government of India — to look for polymetallic nodules, polymetallic sulphides, and cobalt-rich ferromanganese crusts in the deep seabed. China alone is expected to mine 17% of the Clarion-Clipperton Zone.The new finding raises the possibility of such mining damaging ecosystems that require ‘dark oxygen’ to survive. Experts have found deep-sea mining itself could be harmful to the marine environment, ‘dark oxygen’ or not.In 1989-1996, scientists from Germany conducted the Disturbance and Recolonisation (DISCOL) Experiment in the Peru Basin as the world’s “first large-scale impact assessment” to assess the “environmental impacts originating from the mining of polymetallic nodules”. They built a device that disturbed the sea floor like a deep-sea mining exercise might have and collected data about how the disturbances changed local oceanographic and sedimentological profiles, among other things.A 2019 study in the journal Scientific Reports reported that “the effects of simulated mining impacts induced during the DISCOL [Experiment] were still evident in the megabenthos of the Peru Basin after 26 years.”The same study also reported “significantly lower heterogeneity diversity in disturbed areas” and added that “if the results of this experiment … can be extrapolated to the Clarion-Clipperton Zone, the impacts of polymetallic nodule mining there may be greater than expected, and could potentially lead to an irreversible loss of some ecosystem functions”.In November 2023, Nature reported based on a paper published then that deep-sea mining “for minerals could harm deep-sea jellyfish, according to the first study of mining impacts on animals living in the water column.”Scientists also know less about ecosystems in the abyssal zone than they do about many of those aboveground, which means the models scientists use to predict their fate and their role in global climate processes could be unreliable. With these and other issues in mind, on July 20, three major European insurance companies said they would exclude deep-sea mining from their underwriting portfolios.‘Dark oxygen’ adds to these challenges. If deep-sea mining doesn’t find sustainable ways to respond to them, it may be rendered altogether infeasible. critical minerals  /  mining  /  minerals  /  The Hindu Explains  Copyright© 2024, THG PUBLISHING PVT LTD. or its affiliated companies.

All Rights Reserved.Authorities say a wildfire burning in Oregon that’s kicking smoke into neighboring Idaho and beyond is now the largest active blaze in the U.S.LOS ANGELES (AP) — Fires burning in California, Oregon, Arizona, Washington and other western states, as well as Canada, have filled the skies in regions of the western U.S. with smoke and haze, forcing some affected areas to declare air quality alerts or advisories. As of Wednesday morning, there were 79 large active wildfires across the country being managed that have burned 1,431,460 acres (579,292 hectares), according to the National Interagency Fire Center. Evacuation orders are in effect for 15 fires in the Northwest, where fires continue to show active to extreme behavior. Communities near several fires in California, the Northern Rockies and the Great Basin are also under evacuation orders. Oregon has 31 large active fires that have burned 791,653 acres (320,371 hectares). The Durkee Fire, the largest active blaze in the U.S., was burning near the Oregon-Idaho border and was 0% contained as of Wednesday morning and had burned nearly 400 square miles (1,036 square kilometers). The Cow Valley, Falls and Lone Rock fires, the next largest, have collectively seared some 404,404 acres (163,657 hectares). There are 12 active large wildfires in both California and Arizona. In the Golden State, the Lake Fire in Santa Barbara has scorched 38,664 acres (15,647 hectares) and was 90% contained; the 2024 SQF Lightning Complex in Tulare has burned 31,309 acres (12,670 hectares) and was 7% contained; and the Shelly Fire in Siskiyou County that’s charred 15,656 acres (6,336 hectares) was 62% contained. Hot, dry and windy conditions have increase fire activity in some areas, including the Hill Fire in northern California.The Black Fire east of Phoenix is the largest in Arizona, followed by the Romero Fire west of Dudleyville.  The Pioneer Fire in Washington is the largest in the state at 30,667 acres (12,410.5 hectares). In Montana, the Deadman Fire in Rosebud County grew to 19,982 acres (8,086 hectares) and was 95% contained. In Canada, there are about 430 active wildfires in British Columbia and 177 in neighboring Alberta, including two that led to the evacuation of up to 25,000 visitors and residents of Canadian Rockies’ largest national park.Fuels and fire behavior advisories were in effect for California, Nevada, Southeast and Central Oregon, Southern Idaho and the Utah and Arizona Strip. Unhealthy air pollution from wildfires have triggered air quality alerts and advisories in regions of the western U.S. The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality issued air quality alerts for the eastern counties of Harney, Malheur, Grant, Baker and Morrow until further notice. Unhealthy air was reported in cities of Bend and La Pine today and forecaster for tomorrow, with smoke expected to continue degrading air quality in La Pine after Thursday. Smoke from the Durkee Fire was choking the air in Boise, Idaho and beyond. An air quality warning was in effect for the entire region on Wednesday.In Idaho, air quality advisories were sent out to the central counties of Ada, Canyon, Gem, Owyhee, Payette and Washington. In north central Washington, the Colville Reservation, all of Chelan County, plus the Methow Valley down to Brewster in Okanogan County were under air quality alerts until further notice.And in Canada, authorities issued an air quality advisory for Calgary, Alberta due to the wildfire smoke. The government agency called it high risk and said children and the elderly should avoid outdoor physical exertion.Wildfire smoke can cause unhealthy air quality in areas many miles away from fires. To stay safe, the South Coast Air Quality Management District recommends people start by learning about air quality conditions and forecasts in their area. Those with an air conditioning system should change filters often, with high-efficiency filters labeled “MERV13” or higher being the most effective at removing smoke particles. Portable HEPA air purifiers also help. To limit exposure to unhealthy air quality, people should stay indoors with windows and doors closed. Avoid heavy exertion outdoors, using fans or swamp coolers that take air from outside, all wood-burning appliances, and lighting candles and incense. If you need to be outside in smoky conditions, a respirator mask such as an N-95 or P-100 can offer some protection. Lastly, know your risks. Some people, such as children and those with heart or lung issues, can be more sensitive to moderate to unhealthy air quality. When cleaning ash after a wildfire, wear goggles and a snug a respirator mask such as an N-95 or P-100. Avoid skin contact with ash by wearing gloves, closed-toe shoes, socks and long pants and shirts. Wash ash from pets and outdoor belonging like cars and toys. Mist floors with water and gently sweep or mop, then collect ash in plastic bags and throw it out. Don’t use leaf blowers. Keep water with ash away from storm drains. And clean inside with a vacuum that has disposable filter bags.AP writer Rob Gillies contributed from Toronto.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.|True|True
29|UN Cultural Agency Rejects Plan to Place Britain's Stonehenge on List of Heritage Sites in Danger|"UN cultural agency rejects plan to place Britain's Stonehenge on list of heritage sites in danger      Print  The United Nations' cultural agency rejected recommendations Wednesday to place Stonehenge on the list of world heritage sites in danger over concerns that Britain's plans to build a nearby highway tunnel threaten the landscape around the prehistoric monument.Stonehenge was built on the flat lands of Salisbury Plain in southern England in stages, starting 5,000 years ago, with the unique stone circle erected in the late Neolithic period about 2,500 B.C.It was added to the UNESCO World Heritage List in 1986 — an honor bestowed upon sites that have special cultural or physical significance.UNESCO experts had recommended listing Stonehenge as ""in danger"" over the plans for highway development.But at the 46th session of the World Heritage Committee, which maintains the list and oversees the conservation of the sites, members led by Kenya and Qatar said Britain's plans to mitigate the effect on the site were sufficient and that it should not be added to the ""in danger"" list.The highway project, which has been touted for decades and mired in legal challenges, is aimed at trying to ease traffic along a stretch of road prone to gridlock by moving the main highway underground and slightly farther away from the famous stone circle.It has faced fierce opposition from local residents and archaeologists, as well as concern from UNESCO, over potential damage to the environment, wildlife and possible new archaeological finds.Kenya, in amending the recommendation to list the site as in danger, focused on the fact that the main stone circle would be farther away from the road with the new construction, and not the experts' assessment that the road project would significantly impact the greater site. It also noted that Britain had considered more than 50 proposals for the highway plan.""What needs to be protected is not just the henge but the overall landscape of which the henge is a central focus,"" the UNESCO experts had argued in their draft proposal, which was rejected.""The main henge is a highly visible and well-known monument and the proposed tunnel would improve its immediate setting, but this monument has to be considered in its context, surrounded by and inextricably linked to a large number of prehistoric features, which together form an ancient landscape.""After rejecting the proposal to list Stonehenge as in danger, the committee agreed to ask Britain for an updated report on the state of conservation of the property by December 2025.UNESCO says a site's inclusion on its List of World Heritage Sites in Danger is not punitive, but rather meant to draw international attention to the urgent need for conservation measures and ""encourage corrective action.""If issues are not rectified, sites face the possibility of being de-listed by UNESCO, though that is rare."|True|True

All Rights Reserved.Eggs of a rare Siamese crocodile species hatch in Cardamom National Park in June, 2024. (Bros Pov/Fauna & Flora via AP)PNOMH PENH, Cambodia (AP) — Conservationists in Cambodia found 106 eggs of rare Siamese crocodile species in a western Cambodian wildlife sanctuary, officials said Thursday, calling it the biggest discovery in the last 20 years, giving new hope for the world’s rarest crocodile species’ survival in the wild.The group discovered the species eggs in Cardamom National Park in May. Between June 27 and 30, a total of 60 eggs were successfully hatched, according to a joint statement issued by the ministries of agriculture and environment along with the conservation group Fauna & Flora.“This discovery indicates that the area is a key habitat for wild crocodiles, providing hope for the species recovery,” the statement said. The area and the young reptiles have been under the protection of Cardamom National Park Wildlife Sanctuary rangers, it added.The crocodile species was once widespread across Southeast Asia but is now listed as critically endangered by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature. It had all but disappeared by the 1990s due to a combination of poaching, habitat destruction and crossbreeding with other crocodile species.Cambodian environment minister, Eang Sophalleth, said his ministry is working on the conservation and habitat restoration of these critically endangered Siamese crocodiles.“The Siamese crocodiles play an important role in the ecosystem and the discovery of the five nets successfully hatching 60 eggs reflects that the Cardamom National Park is a safe and suitable habitat for this species,” Sophalleth said in Thursday’s statement.Eggs of a rare Siamese crocodile species hatch in Cardamom National Park in June, 2024. (Toy Ya/Fauna & Flora via AP) It’s believed only about 1,000 Siamese crocodiles remain in the wild, with more than 300 of them in Cambodia. In 2017, wildlife researchers found six eggs in Sre Ambel district in the southern province of Koh Kong as they were exploring for tracks and signs of the reptile. Later in September 2021, eight hatchlings were found by conservationists in a river in the Srepok wildlife sanctuary in eastern Cambodia which raised hopes for its survival in the wild.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

33|Brazilian Researchers Discover Dinosaur Fossil After Heavy Rains in Rio Grande Do Sul|Brazilian researchers discover dinosaur fossil after heavy rains in Rio Grande do Sul  Copyright 2024 The Associated Press. All Rights Reserved.Brazilian scientists have discovered a skeleton of what they claim is one of the world’s oldest dinosaurs. The remains surfaced after heavy rains in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul accelerated the terrain’s natural erosion. The fossil is believed to be around 233 million years old.RIO DE JANEIRO (AP) — A team of Brazilian scientists has discovered a fossilized skeleton of what they believe is one of the world’s oldest dinosaurs after heavy rains in the southern state of Rio Grande do Sul accelerated the natural process of erosion.The fossil found next to a reservoir in the municipality of Sao Joao do Polesine is around 233 million years old, according to paleontologist Rodrigo Temp Müller, who led the team from the Federal University of Santa Maria that found the bones in May.The claims have not been verified by other scientists or published in a scientific journal. The researcher believes the dinosaur lived during the Triassic period, when all continents were part of a single land mass called Pangaea. Dinosaurs are thought to have first evolved at that time. The apex predator discovered in Rio Grande do Sul belongs to the group known as Herrerasauridae — a family of dinosaurs that used to wander across lands that now make up present-day Brazil and Argentina, according to a fact sheet about the discovery shared with The Associated Press.The size of the bones reveals that the dinosaur would have reached around 2.5 meters (8.2 feet) in length, according to the document.Rodrigo Temp Müller said that he and his team were “very excited and surprised” by their findings.After around four days of excavations, the group of researchers transported a block of rock containing the specimen back to the laboratory, where they ran tests. “Initially it seemed like just a few isolated bones, but as we exposed the material, we were able to see that we had an almost complete skeleton,” Müller said. The expert hypothesizes that their discovery is the second most complete skeleton for this type of dinosaur. Researchers will now try to determine whether the fossil belongs to an already-known species or a new kind. That work is expected to take several months, as the process is meticulous to ensure no damaged is caused.Fossils are more likely to appear after rains, as water exposes the materials by removing the sediment that covers them, in a phenomenon known as weathering. Rio Grande do Sul saw record amounts of rainfall earlier this year. That caused devastating floods in May that killed at least 182 people, according to a toll published by the state’s civil defense on July 8.Extreme weather events are made more likely by climate change, principally caused by the burning of oil, gas and coal.Müller said that more fossils are appearing because of the heavy rains, which has launched a race against time to rescue the materials before they are ruined.In the field, his team observed “a leg bone and a pelvis bone in the pelvic region that were already being destroyed due to the rain,” he said.Müller hopes the discovery will contribute to elucidate the origins of dinosaurs.“Having new fossils that are so well preserved certainly helps us better understand this topic that is still much debated,” he said.Copyright 2024 The Associated Press.

34|Scientists Have Confirmed a Cave on the Moon That Could Be Used to Shelter Future Explorers|Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon that could be used to shelter future explorers   To enjoy additional benefitsCONNECT WITH USUpdated  - July 15, 2024 09:10 pm IST Published - July 15, 2024 08:52 pm IST - Cape Canaveral Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon, not far from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago this week, and suspect there are hundreds more that could house future astronauts.   Photo Credit: AP Scientists have confirmed a cave on the moon, not far from where Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin landed 55 years ago, and suspect there are hundreds more that could house future astronauts.An Italian-led team reported Monday that there’s evidence for a sizable cave accessible from the deepest known pit on the moon. It’s located at the Sea of Tranquility, just 250 miles (400 kilometers) from Apollo 11’s landing site.The pit, like the more than 200 others discovered up there, was created by the collapse of a lava tube.Researchers analyzed radar measurements by NASA’s Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter, and compared the results with lava tubes on Earth. Their findings appeared in the journal Nature Astronomy.The radar data reveals only the initial part of the underground cavity, according to the scientists. They estimate it’s at least 130 feet (40 meters) wide and tens of yards (meters) long, probably more. Also Read: The third human landing on the moon“Lunar caves have remained a mystery for over 50 years. So it was exciting to be able to finally prove the existence” of one, Leonardo Carrer and Lorenzo Bruzzone of the University of Trento, wrote in an email.Most of the pits seem to be located in the moon’s ancient lava plains, according to the scientists. There also could be some at the moon’s south pole, the planned location of NASA’s astronaut landings later this decade. Permanently shadowed craters there are believed to hold frozen water that could provide drinking water and rocket fuel.During NASA’s Apollo program, 12 astronauts landed on the moon, beginning with Armstrong and Aldrin on July 20, 1969.The findings suggest there could be hundreds of pits on the moon and thousands of lava tubes. Such places could serve as a natural shelter for astronauts, protecting them from cosmic rays and solar radiation as well as from micrometeorite strikes. Building habitats from scratch would be more time-consuming and challenging, even when factoring in the potential need of reinforcing the cave walls to prevent a collapse, the team said.Rocks and other material inside these caves — unaltered by the harsh surface conditions over the eons — also can help scientists better understand how the moon evolved, especially involving its volcanic activity. space programme  /  space programme BACK TO TOPTerms & conditions     Institutional SubscriberComments have to be in English, and in full sentences.

36|To Save Spotted Owls  US Officials Plan to Kill Hundreds of Thousands of Another Owl Species|"To save spotted owls, US officials plan to kill hundreds of thousands of another owl species   To save the imperiled spotted owl from potential extinction, U.S. wildlife officials are embracing a contentious plan to deploy trained shooters into dense West Coast forests to kill almost a half-million barred owls that are crowding out their cousins.  The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service strategy released Wednesday is meant to prop up declining spotted owl populations in Oregon, Washington state and California. The Associated Press obtained details in advance.  Documents released by the agency show up to about 450,000 barred owls would be shot over three decades after the birds from the eastern U.S. encroached into the West Coast territory of two owls: northern spotted owls and California spotted owls. The smaller spotted owls have been unable to compete with the invaders, which have large broods and need less room to survive than spotted owls.  Past efforts to save spotted owls focused on protecting the forests where they live, sparking bitter fights over logging but also helping slow the birds' decline. The proliferation of barred owls in recent years is undermining that earlier work, officials said.  “Without actively managing barred owls, northern spotted owls will likely go extinct in all or the majority of their range, despite decades of collaborative conservation efforts,"" said Fish and Wildlife Service Oregon state supervisor Kessina Lee.  The notion of killing one bird species to save another has divided wildlife advocates and conservationists. It's reminiscent of past government efforts to save West Coast salmon by killing sea lions and cormorants that prey on the fish, and to preserve warblers by killing cowbirds that lay eggs in warbler nests.  Some advocates grudgingly accepted the barred owl removal strategy; others said it's reckless diversion from needed forest preservation.  “The Fish and Wildlife Service is turning from protector of wildlife to persecutor of wildlife,” said Wayne Pacelle, founder of the advocacy group Animal Wellness Action. He predicted the program would fail because the agency won't be able to keep more barred owls from migrating into areas where others have been killed.  The shootings would likely begin next spring, officials said. Barred owls would be lured using megaphones to broadcast recorded owl calls, then shot with shotguns. Carcasses would be buried on site.  The birds already are being killed by researchers in some spotted owl habitats, with about 4,500 removed since 2009, said Robin Bown, barred owl strategy leader for the Fish and Wildlife Service. Those targeted included barred owls in California’s Sierra Nevada region, where the animals have only recently arrived and officials want to stop populations from taking hold.  In other areas where barred owls are more established, officials aim to reduce their numbers but acknowledge shooting owls is unlikely to eliminate them entirely.  Supporters include the American Bird Conservancy and other conservation groups.  Barred owls don’t belong in the West, said American Bird Conservancy Vice President Steve Holmer. Killing them is unfortunate, he added, but reducing their numbers could allow them to live alongside spotted owls over the long term.  “As the old forests are allowed to regrow, hopefully coexistence is possible and maybe we don’t need to do as much” shooting, Holmer said.  The killings would reduce nationwide barred owl numbers by less than 1%, officials said. That compares with potential extinction for spotted owls should the problem go unaddressed.  Public hunting of barred owls wouldn't be allowed. The wildlife service would designate government agencies, landowners, American Indian tribes or companies to carry out the killings. Shooters would have to provide documentation of training or experience in owl identification and firearm skills.  The publishing in the coming days of a final environmental study on the proposal will open a 30-day comment period before a final decision is made.  The barred owl plan follows decades of conflict between conservationists and timber companies, which cut down vast areas of older forests where spotted owls reside.  Early efforts to save the birds culminated in logging bans in the 1990s that roiled the timber industry and its political supporters in Congress.  Yet spotted owl populations continued declining after barred owls started showing up on the West Coast several decades ago. Across study sites in the region, at least half of spotted owls have been lost, with losses topping 75% in some areas, said Katherine Fitzgerald, who leads the wildlife service's northern spotted owl recovery program.  Opponents say the mass killing of barred owls would cause severe disruption to forest ecosystems and could lead to other species — including spotted owls — being mistakenly shot. They’ve also challenged the notion that barred owls don’t belong on the West Coast, characterizing their expanding range as a natural ecological phenomenon.  Researchers say barred owls moved westward by one of two routes: across the Great Plains, where trees planted by settlers gave them a foothold in new areas; or via Canada’s boreal forests, which have become more hospitable as temperatures rise because of climate change.  Northern spotted owls are federally protected as a threatened species. Federal officials determined in 2020 that their continued decline merited an upgrade to the more critical designation of “endangered.” But the Fish and Wildlife Service refused to do so at the time, saying other species took priority.  California spotted owls were proposed for federal protections last year. A decision is pending.  Under former President Donald Trump, government officials stripped habitat protections for spotted owls at the behest of the timber industry. Those were reinstated under President Joe Biden after the Interior Department said political appointees under Trump relied on faulty science to justify their weakening of protections.

37|A new algae-based menstrual pad could stop leaks|A new algae-based menstrual pad could stop leaks  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The prototype turns period blood into a gelMenstrual blood can be unpredictable, and it can often easily leak through commercially available products.Johner Images/Getty ImagesBy Claire YuanJuly 26, 2024 at 11:00 amMenstruation can be messy and uncomfortable, often due to leaky pads, tampons and cups. A new alginate-based powder may solve that problem. The material, which solidifies menstrual blood by turning it into a gel mixture, could reduce leakage in period products without compromising capacity, researchers report July 10 in Matter.“Our paper is a proof of concept,” says Rogério Aparecido Bataglioli, a chemical engineer at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg. Before being used commercially, he says, the materials would need to be assessed for safety and scalability.Most menstrual pads use cellulose-based materials to absorb period blood. Though they are effective, many people who menstruate still struggle with leakage and mess.To solve this problem, the team turned to alginate, a naturally occurring substance derived from algae and seaweed. After the researchers screened a large pool of potential polysaccharides — long chains of carbohydrate molecules — that could have blood-absorbing properties, alginate excelled at absorbing and gelling blood. It also has already been approved by the Food and Drug Administration for use in pharmaceuticals, food and medical materials.To further improve the alginate’s absorption, the researchers added glycerol. They then tested the absorbency of these alginate-glycerol powders against commercial absorbents by sandwiching each between sheets of gauze. The team dripped modified pig blood through a model vagina to mimic menstruation before performing a squeeze test on the blood-soaked materials. Though both were good at absorbing the blood, when the simulated period pads with commercial absorbent were compressed, it was “like squeezing a sponge,” says Bryan Hsu, a microbiologist at Virginia Tech. With the alginate material, which gelled the blood, the pads leaked less under pressure.To assess the leakage of alginate-based menstrual pads, researchers wrapped the new material in gauze and dripped pig blood on it. They then lightly centrifuged the pads on top of well plates to mimic compression and collect the leakage. They did the same thing for three other scenarios: no added material, commercial pad fillers and polyacrylate, the industry gold-standard superabsorbent polymer. Click through the slideshow below to see how each fared.The team also tested their new material in menstrual cups. They packed the alginate-glycerol powder into a long and narrow cotton sheath that was then coiled around inside of the cup. After the blood entered the menstrual cup and encountered the alginate, it gelled. Then, the blood could be removed along with the cotton tube — and a new one could be reinserted — with minimal liquid mess. In solidifying the menstrual blood into a gel, Hsu says, the goal is to make menstrual cup removal and cleaning easier and tidier.One limitation of the study, notes ob–gyn Abigail Liberty, is that the blood was defibrinated pig blood, which does not contain fibrin, a protein involved in clotting. Though she applauds the team for using blood instead of another model fluid, menstrual blood is “different than blood that’s just floating around the body,” says Liberty, of Oregon Health & Science University in Portland (SN: 4/16/24). “It’s secreted in a different way. It’s grown, it’s released in a different way.”Due to a shortage of research on menstrual care and period products, Bataglioli and colleagues did not have a base of experimental techniques to draw from and adapt. Instead, they designed many of their methods from scratch. “That’s a message to the scientific community — there’s nothing out there,” says Zeinab Hosseinidoust, a biomedical engineer at McMaster University in Hamilton, Canada. “Even more important than the actual research that was done is the message that this work sends.”Questions or comments on this article?

After a dose of psilocybin, activity changes dramatically as neural collectives fall out of sync (yellow, orange and red). After the drug wears off, activity returns to normal. Sara Moser/Washington UniversityBy Laura SandersJuly 17, 2024 at 11:00 amInside your skull, your brain hums along with its own unique pattern of activity, a neural fingerprint that’s yours and yours alone. A heavy dose of psilocybin temporarily wipes the prints clean.The psychedelic drug psilocybin dramatically changes how collections of nerve cells work in the brain, eliminating normal communication between brain regions, a new brain scanning study published July 17 in Nature shows. These brain images, taken before, during and after a high dose of psilocybin, expand the understanding of the drug’s effects, which is being studied for its promise in treating mental health disorders such as depression.The brain scanning protocol researchers used was intense. “We had a small number of people, just seven participants in the whole study, but an enormous amount of data on each one,” says Joshua Siegel, a neuroscientist and psychiatrist at Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. Each person underwent about 18 functional MRI brain scans, one roughly every other day, over the course of the study.That repeated scanning gives “an unprecedented view on how brain connectivity evolves after a dose of psilocybin,” says Alex Kwan, a neuroscientist at Cornell University who wasn’t involved in the study.In the first part of the experiment, Siegel and colleagues recorded each person’s baseline brain activity, the unique patterns that emerge much like a fingerprint’s whorls, loops and arches when a person simply rests.Later in the study, researchers gave participants 25 milligrams of psilocybin, a key ingredient in some hallucinogenic mushrooms, and watched what happened in the scanner. On a different day, for comparison, each participant also got a dose of methylphenidate, the generic form of Ritalin, a stimulant that affects the brain.The effects of psilocybin were obvious, and big. “Psilocybin had humongous acute effects on the human brain,” says Nico Dosenbach, a neuroscientist also at Washington University School of Medicine. “Way, way, way bigger than the active control,” the methylphenidate.Some of the biggest changes were in a brain system known as the default mode network, or DMN. This coordinated group of brain regions is active when nothing particular is happening. Scientists think that the DMN has a role in creating our sense of self (SN: 7/3/09). “It’s multiple parts of the brain across both hemispheres, but they’re all activating and deactivating in a very organized, synchronous way,” Siegel says. “And with psilocybin, it essentially becomes chaos.”Dosenbach can attest that the drug causes a loss of sense of self. Along with being a researcher on the study, he was one of the seven study participants, giving him an unusual perspective on psilocybin’s effects on the brain. “You read about it, and you think about it and then you experience it, and you’re like, ‘Wow, that’s even more real.’”Signs of those experiences showed up in the MRI scans. The team saw that psilocybin seemed to wipe clean the participants’ neural fingerprints. Dosenbach has an analogy to explain the brain changes in the scans: “You’d be like, ‘That is my face, and that is your face.’ And then you took a medicine, and we both had a puppy face — very similar, but very different from our normal faces.”A day after taking the drug, most of psilocybin’s brain changes were gone, Siegel says. But one change persisted for three weeks. There was diminished coordination between the DMN and a part of the hippocampus, a structure involved in memory. Researchers don’t yet know how long this change might last, how it affects the brain overall or if it could hint at psilocybin’s therapeutic effects. It was not present in data from four of the participants who came in for scans six to 12 months later, but the study didn’t have enough data to say with certainty that it was gone.The findings add to earlier work that sought to understand how psychedelic drugs change brains and show that the effects are far from simple. “Psilocybin is not simply tuning brain activity up or down,” Kwan says. “The results paint a more complex and nuanced picture for how psychedelics change neural activity dynamics than previously thought.”Recent studies point to the promise of psychedelic drugs as therapies for depression, post-traumatic stress disorder, addiction and more (SN: 12/3/21). Understanding how these drugs affect the brain in the hours, days and months after taking it may lead to better treatments for some of these disorders.Questions or comments on this article?

42|Honeybees can “smell” lung cancer|"Michigan researches say honey bees can detect lung cancer  Watch CBS News     By                                        Kelly Vaughen  June 13, 2024 / 12:06 AM EDT           / CBS Detroit         (CBS DETROIT) - Researchers at Michigan State University have found that honey bees could detect lung cancer.Bees have long provided humans with honey, wax, and the pollination of around 80% of our flowering plants, but they could also sniff out cancer in the future.Dogs have been used as a medical diagnostic tool, as they can sense seizures, among other things. However, MSU researchers said bees also have an incredible sense of smell, are cheaper, and require less training and upkeep than dogs.The process starts with brain surgery on the live bees, done under a microscope.""You definitely notice how much your hands shake,"" said Michael Parnas, a Ph.D candidate at Michigan State University.He said they used a 3D-printed harness to hold the live bee as they opened its head to the part of its brain dealing with smell.""And we can plant an electrode in there to basically record how those are responding as we present odors to the insect.Parnas said they then presented the bees with a mixture replicating the breath of someone with lung cancer, using lab-grown human cancer cells. They found bees could detect biomarkers or chemical concentrations associated with cancer.The insects were not only able to distinguish between cancer and healthy breath but could also differentiate between the six different types of lung cancer cells they smelled. They could also detect very small concentrations of cancer.""Think like one molecule in a swimming pool sort of concentrations,"" Parnas said. ""It doesn't surprise me at all,"" said Brian Peterson-Roest, the co-founder and president of Bees in the D.  Bees in the D is a nonprofit that provides education and conservation for pollinators. Peterson-Roest said bees have an incredible sense of smell. ""It's kind of funny, I tell people. With my truck, there's all kinds of bee smells because I take honey frames and stuff like that. Literally within a minute if not 30 seconds, bees start showing up. Because they can smell those different odorants that are in the back of my truck,"" he said.He said bees are crucial for our food industry and ecosystem and could soon be for our healthcare. MSU researchers said the science on cancer detection is early, but they hope that based on their findings, people could soon get a noninvasive early-detection cancer test.Kelly Vaughen is a reporter and weekend evening anchor for CBS News Detroit.

43|A malaria drug could be used to treat PCOS  a common hormone disorder|A malaria drug could be used to treat PCOS, a common hormone disorder  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Artemisinin reduced ovarian cysts and restored normal menstruation in people with PCOSIn polycystic ovarian syndrome, cysts form from follicles holding unreleased eggs (right ovary in this illustration compared with a healthy ovary, left). PCOS affects hundreds of millions of people worldwide, but effective treatments remain elusive.Kateryna Kon/Science Photo Library/Getty ImagesBy Darren IncorvaiaJune 13, 2024 at 2:00 pmUpdated June 13, 2024 at 3:45 pmA common antimalarial drug could also be used to treat polycystic ovarian syndrome, an endocrine disorder that affects hundreds of millions of people of reproductive age worldwide.After receiving repeated doses of artemisinin, a small group of women with PCOS had lower blood testosterone levels and healthier-looking ovaries, researchers report in the June 14 Science. The results suggest artemisinin compounds, which are already known to be effective against malaria, lupus and cancer, could also be used to alleviate symptoms of PCOS.The discovery could “potentially change the landscape of PCOS treatment,” Elisabet Stener-Victorin, an endocrinologist at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm who was not involved in the research, writes in a perspective in the same issue of Science. “Although further studies will be needed … the discovery of artemisinins as effective remedies for PCOS nonetheless represents a promising new approach.”Despite the prevalence of PCOS, what causes the disorder is not known. Doctors diagnose it based on elevated levels of hormones called androgens, which includes testosterone, and a plethora of small cysts on patients’ ovaries. Treatments tend to target specific symptoms, such as acne, excess hair growth, irregular menstruation or infertility. People with PCOS are also at higher risk of metabolic conditions such as type 2 diabetes, and researchers now think that underlying changes to the systems controlling our metabolism, like the one involving insulin, are to blame for both.In 2016, Qi-Qun Tang, a molecular biologist and medical researcher at Fudan University in Shanghai, was studying adipocytes, better known as fat cells, and metabolic diseases. Screening 3,000 drugs, Tang and colleagues identified the Nobel Prize–winning drug artemisinin as a promising candidate to turn white adipose tissue into brown or beige adipose tissue, which is easier to lose, to treat symptoms of obesity (SN: 10/5/15). Coincidentally, around the same time, another group found that brown adipose tissue could be used to treat PCOS in rats.“We became interested in investigating the potential impact of artemisinins on PCOS,” Tang says.The team first tested the idea in rodents, injecting female mice with an androgen called dehydroepiandrosterone to induce PCOS symptoms. If mice were also simultaneously given artemisinin along with the hormone, PCOS-like symptoms such as an interrupted fertility cycle, elevated testosterone in the blood and ovarian cysts never developed. After seeing similar results in rats, the team tested the drug in a small clinical study of people with PCOS.Nineteen patients took dihydroartemisinin, the form of artemisinin used to treat malaria, three times a day for three months. After this treatment regimen, 12 of the patients began having regular menstrual cycles, and most of the patients had lower blood testosterone levels and fewer developing follicles in their ovaries. Follicles contain egg cells that are released during ovulation in order to be fertilized. Having an overabundance of them is a sign of PCOS; a follicle that does not release an egg can develop into a cyst.Biochemical tests showed artemisinin helps degrade a testosterone-making protein called CYP11A1, which contains heme, resulting in less testosterone in the blood to interfere with the ovaries’ normal activity. Heme contains iron, which can react with artemisinin to produce toxic forms of oxygen that can go on to kill malarial parasites or cancer cells, says Yang Liu, a biologist also at Fudan University. These cellular interactions with heme are most likely how artemisinin works against so many different ailments.We still need to understand where else in the body artemisinin is acting, says Sireesha Reddy, an obstetrician and gynecologist at Texas Tech University Health Sciences Center El Paso, who cautions that the results are very preliminary and need to be replicated by other researchers. She suggests investigating how the drug affects cardiometabolic symptoms of PCOS by measuring levels of insulin and lipids in the blood, and how it works in patients with more severe PCOS, like those with higher weights and BMIs than the individuals in this study.The team next plans to test different forms and dosages of artemisinin to find what works best against PCOS before potentially moving on to larger clinical trials. Tang says he is also keen to see if artemisinin can restore one of PCOS’s most serious symptoms — patients’ loss of fertility. “We have a long way to go to see how they can get fertility back.”Questions or comments on this article?

44|Gen X has higher cancer rates than their baby boomer parents|Gen X has higher cancer rates than their baby boomer parents  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Experts call for policies to promote healthier lifestyles in light of a concerning uptickCancer is on the rise in the United States in Generation X (people born between 1965 and 1980) compared with their parents’ generations, a new study shows. That could be bad news for younger generations, like the boy in this multigenerational family.Oliver Rossi/Stone/Getty Images PlusBy Tina Hesman SaeyJune 10, 2024 at 11:00 amGeneration X is outdoing baby boomers, but not in a good way.Per capita, Gen X (born from 1965 through 1980) is getting cancer more often than their parents’ and grandparents’ generations, researchers report June 10 in JAMA Network Open. The forecast doesn’t look good for Gen Xers, who are starting to reach ages when cancers most often appear, say Philip Rosenberg, a biostatistician at U.S. National Cancer Institute in Rockville, Md. If the trend continues, millennials (born from 1981 to 1996) and younger generations might also experience more cancer, Rosenberg and his NCI colleague Adalberto Miranda-Filho warn.Rosenberg, who describes himself as a boomer, wanted to see whether his generation (born from 1946 through 1964) was better off than his parents’ Greatest (1908–1927) and Silent (1928–1945) generations. And whether his millennial (1981–1996) and Gen Z (1997–2012) children might be better off still. “You hope to see things get better when it comes to health metrics, life expectancy [and] cancer rates,” he says. “You hope to see all that improve.”Rosenberg and Miranda-Filho gathered data from 3.8 million people diagnosed with invasive cancer. The researchers compared generational differences in diagnoses of cancer at multiple sites in the body, and projected Gen X’s rate at age 60. Gen X is of an age to develop cancers, so the researchers could detect trends for them. Since millennials are not yet old enough to get many cancers, the team couldn’t make estimates for that generation.The forecast was not what Rosenberg had hoped. Compared with baby boomers, Gen X women had projected increases in thyroid, kidney, rectal, uterine, colon, pancreatic and ovarian cancers, as well as non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma and leukemia. Gen X men have forecasted rises in thyroid, kidney, rectal, colon and prostate cancers. The study looks at how often people are newly diagnosed with cancer, not at whether they die of it.There were some bright spots too. Gen X women had decreases in lung and cervical cancers compared with baby boomers, while Gen X men had less lung, liver and gallbladder cancers and non-Hodgkin’s lymphoma.But when combining all the cancers, the picture was bleak because the “gaining cancers numerically overtook falling cancers,” the researchers found.  Generation X is being diagnosed with more cancer than earlier generations in the United States. Researchers lumped 20 leading cancers for women (yellow lines) and 18 for men (blue lines) to forecast trends in overall cancer rates at age 60. (Since the oldest Gen Xers are just approaching 60, shaded areas indicate possible ranges where the incidence rate could land, although the solid line is the most likely projection.) The graphs chart cancer diagnoses per person-year (p-y), that is, how often you would expect a cancer diagnosis if you watched 100,000 people for a year.Among men, cancer diagnoses declined in the Greatest and Silent Generations but then ticked up again in Boomers and continue to rise in Gen X. Asian and Pacific Islander men are the exception. Their cancer rates continued to decline into Gen X. Women tended to get fewer cancers than men in early generations, but the differences have largely been erased, except in the non-Hispanic Black population where men still get cancer more often. Scroll through to see how cancer incidence has changed through the generations for four racial or ethnic groups.Hispanic women had one of the biggest increases, a rise of 35 percent. They went from 598 cancers diagnosed per 100,000 person-years in the Silent and boomer generations (born from 1936 through 1960) to 806 diagnoses per 100,000 person-years in Gen X.  That rate is the number of new cancer diagnoses you would expect if you watched 100,000 people for a year. All racial and ethnic groups included in the study experienced increases in cancer diagnoses except for Asian and Pacific Islander men, for whom cancer rates fell from 562 cancers diagnosed per 100,000 person-years at age 60 in the Silent and boomer generation to 519 cancers per 100,000 person-years for Gen Xers, a decrease of 7.7 percent. Non-Hispanic Black men in Gen X had the highest combined rate of cancer at 1,561 cases per 100,000 person-years. That’s up about 12 percent from the 1,399 cancer diagnoses per 100,000 person-years in the boomer and Silent generations.Increases in many cancers, including colorectal cancers in people under 50, and upticks in kidney and thyroid cancers have previously been noted, says cancer epidemiologist Ahmedin Jemal of the American Cancer Society in Atlanta (SN: 8/14/23). And the jump is not limited to the United States. Other high-income countries have reported similar increases.The uptick of cancer in Gen X “is like a yellow flag,” Rosenberg says. “These numbers suggest there are some unfavorable trajectories.” He hopes other researchers will use the data to uncover what is driving those increases and find ways to turn the trends around.Researchers are only beginning to gather data on Gen X and cancer as people in that generation reach middle age, says Corinne Joshu, a cancer epidemiologist at the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health.Some of the increase may be due to better screening and early detection, Joshu says. “Sometimes that’s hard to say how much of this is related to changes in detection and changes in just clinical awareness to look for something, versus a true increase.” Some prostate cancers can be nasty, but many will be so slow growing that they don’t cause health problems, so there are concerns about overdiagnosing such cancers, she says.Many of the cancers on the rise among Gen Xers are linked to obesity, lack of exercise, eating too much red meat and other lifestyle factors. But changing that is not easy, Joshu says. “The healthy choices are not the easy choices to make in our society.”She and Jemal say that drops in lung cancer came about because of multilayered policy changes that banned smoking indoors and taxes that made cigarettes too expensive for people most likely to start smoking as teenagers. Vaccines against human papillomavirus (HPV) and other public health measures have been instrumental in reducing cervical cancer (SN: 4/28/17).But taking something away that isn’t good for health may be easier than making positive lifestyle changes accessible and affordable for everyone, Joshu says. “We do not see it easier and more affordable to eat healthier,” she says. “I think we could move the needle on that, but it takes societal effort and for people to come together and say, ‘This is important and it’s worth changing.’ … And that presumably would lead to not only a decrease in cancer, but a decrease in [other] major causes of death.”Questions or comments on this article?

45|Young people’s use of diabetes and weight loss drugs is up 600 percent |Prescriptions for weight loss, diabetes drugs for young people leaped 600% since 2020, study says                    The number of young people in the US who are prescribed GLP-1 agonist drugs like Wegovy and Ozempic for weight loss and diabetes soared 594.4% in just three years, according to new research.                  Demand for these drugs has skyrocketed for people of all ages recently, but the study, which was published Wednesday in the journal JAMA, found that between 2020 and 2023, the number of prescriptions written for people ages 12 to 25 increased from 8,722 to 60,567.                  Young women and adolescent girls had the biggest increase in the number of prescriptions.                  The study looked information from a database that reports prescriptions from more than 93% of retail pharmacies in the United States, although the data cannot capture what exactly the prescriptions were intended to treat and whether the patient actually used the medications.      Related article Many people using GLP-1s for weight loss stop treatment too soon, research shows, and results are not one-size-fits-all              For context, the study authors also looked at prescription trends for other medications and found that there was a 3% decrease in the prescription of other drugs for this age category during this same time period.                  The study looked at Ozempic (which uses the active ingredient semaglutide), Trulicity (dulaglutide) and Byetta (exenatide), which are approved to treat type 2 diabetes and can help with weight loss, and Saxenda (liraglutide) and Wegovy (semaglutide), which are approved for weight management. Each can be prescribed for children as young as 10 or 12. Tirzepatide, sold as Zepbound and Mounjaro, is approved only for adults.                  The authors from the University of Michigan Medical School and Yale University said that, given how many young people are being prescribed these medications, efforts to promote safe and appropriate prescribing should include endocrinologists, doctors who practice family medicine and nurse practitioners.                  Obesity and type 2 diabetes are affecting an increasing number of young people. The number of people ages 10 to 19 with type 2 diabetes doubled just over the past two decades in the US, a 2023 study found. The study predicted that by 2060, the number of young people with type 2 diabetes will increase 673%.      Related article Weight-loss surgery is becoming more common among children and teens, new research shows              Obesity is also a significant problem for young people in the US, where the average young adult is now overweight, according to a 2023 study. About 1 in 6 adolescents is overweight, and almost 1 in 5 has obesity, studies show. Obesity alone affects 14.4 million children and teens in the US.                  Having obesity as a young person significantly increases a person’s chance of weight problems when they are older, research shows. Obesity and overweight can also be a significant risk factor for other health conditions like heart disease, kidney problems and even cancer, studies show, in additional to mental health conditions.      Dr. Melanie Cree, a pediatric endocrinologist at Children’s Hospital Colorado who has been working with this class of medication in clinical trials with children for almost a decade, says the drugs have been a game-changer not just to help kids lose weight and lower blood sugar, but also to  lower liver fat and improve cardiac and kidney function – “all of those conditions that go with type 2 diabetes.”                  “So it’s not only that they’re lowering blood sugars. It’s that they appear to be decreasing the complications that we see from type 2 diabetes, so that they’re really affecting multiple aspects,” said Cree, who was not involved with the new study. “They’re really changing the face of what diabetes looks like in an individual and in the field of diabetes across the board.”                  The American Academy of Pediatrics updated its guidelines for managing obesity last year and said that, in addition to behavior and lifestyle treatments for the whole family, the use of weight loss medications is appropriate for children 12 and over.                  Cree said she sees few downsides to these drugs. Some of her patients have had to stop taking them or can’t take as much because of side effects like nausea, and she’d like to see more research on that topic.                  When her patients can get access, Cree said, the positive changes have been significant. Many have experienced “profound” weight loss, she said, transforming their lives.                  The most significant downsides have nothing to do with the physical impact of the medications; rather, it’s that the medicine can be expensive and many of her patients can’t get insurance to cover the cost, particularly if they’re used for weight loss. Additionally, many patients have had a hard time filling prescriptions because of drug shortages.                  One parent of a child who lost a significant amount of weight told Cree that the medicine gave her her daughter back.                  “I had another girl who, after some weight loss, went to prom last fall, and it was the first dance she had ever gone to, because it was the first time she felt comfortable wearing a dress,” Cree said. “So really, really poignant stories from these adolescents. I just feel privileged to be a part of their life and be able to share in these transformations and moments with them.”     © 2024 Cable News Network. A Warner Bros. Discovery Company.

One circuit underlies the positive feelings this powerful drug elicits, while the other was responsible for the intense withdrawal when it is taken away.

I’m Lizzie Gibney.Nick Petrić HoweAnd I'm Nick Petrić Howe.Nick Petrić HoweOpioids, like fentanyl, are behind tens of thousands of deaths every year in the US alone, and that is in large part down to their very addictive nature. The drugs have two main effects on the brain that contribute to this: one, they make you feel good — they reward you for taking them, and two, if you stop taking them you feel bad — you get withdrawal.And whilst these two effects are known to drive addiction, the underlying neuronal mechanism is unclear. And that’s a problem, because whilst these drugs have great potential to do harm, they are also incredibly useful for pain relief. A better understanding of what’s going on in the brain could allow scientists to design drugs that are less addictive, whilst still keeping their benefits.And that is precisely what Christian Lüscher from the University of Geneva in Switzerland, and his collaborators, have done - in mice - using the particularly potent drug, fentanyl. Here’s Christian.Christian LüscherSo far, when you look in the textbook, the explanation that is usually given is that opioids very strongly activates the dopamine system. And when they do so for some time, weeks, or even months, and then all of a sudden, they're not available, that system is sort of exhausted. And then you have a situation where you have not enough dopamine. And that would explain why people have this aversive state and they feel down. Now our work looked into this and we needed to do this in mice, because only there we can actually do all these molecular manipulations. And the first observation we made, which was very surprising is when you take out the protein, the receptor that is responsible for that positive reinforcement, in the reward system, the withdrawal is still normal. So there is there's still dependence and when the animal no longer has access to an opioid, they will show all the signs of withdrawal syndrome. So the– the explanation that it is the same system that causes the positive reinforcement, as well as the negative reinforcement didn't seem to hold. And so that was the beginning of our study.Nick Petrić HoweSo rather than there just being this one system that does both these things, there seem to be two different systems that do this sort of like withdrawal part and this reward pathway. How did you identify what was going on in these two different pathways?Christian LüscherSo we put the mice in situation where they will go into withdrawal. And we looked in many, many different brain regions, which ones were active. You can do this by monitoring a gene a so called immediate early gene that reflects the neuronal activity. And we had then a few candidate areas where something really interesting is going on during withdrawal, one of which was the central amygdala. And that's why we focused our attention then on this particular part of the brain.Nick Petrić HoweAnd what is the central amygdala normally involved in?Christian LüscherSo it's involved in fear responses, in anxiety. And so it's, of course, the brain regions that people know very well. What we have been able to contribute with this, that we identified the population of cells that express the receptor for the opiates, it's called the µ-opioid receptor. And that was unknown until then how exactly these cells are located in the central amygdala. And that is how we were able to identify that it is actually those cells, which are the entry gate if you will, of this negative reinforcement for opiates.Nick Petrić HoweAnd this is in contrast to the other one that's doing the more sort of positive reward side.Christian LüscherSure. So, then we now change from a model where one system would be responsible for both the positive and the negative reinforcement to a system where you would have two distinct circuits that mediate one and the other.Nick Petrić HoweAnd not only the identify these neurons and their relative locations in the brain, but you also manipulated them to show that there was a very causal mechanism going on here.Christian LüscherThat's the beauty of current modern circuit neuroscience. You cannot observe what happens in the cells but then you have actually tools to manipulate and these are largely optogenetic tools. That is, you can manipulate those cells by putting in ion channels that are light sensitive and you can either activate or inhibit the cells. And so, I guess the crucial experiment that really indicates causality was when we were able to put an opsin into these cells of the central amygdala, that activates those cells, and we made them active continuously. And we showed that this is very similar to the aversive state that the animal feels in opiate withdrawal. And so the animal then was given the opportunity to press a lever to pause this activation, and that they learned very quickly. So, this is precisely the definition of negative reinforcement, you do an action to alleviate an aversive state. And what's more, this mechanism is then also sensitive to the injection of fentanyl. So, we could block this behaviour by exposing the animal a little bit to fentanyl.Nick Petrić HoweSo, what do you think this means for our sort of understanding of opioids and addiction, that there are these two pathways?Christian LüscherSo for first, it's a gain in knowledge we better understand and now we can focus on the cellular mechanism and the molecular mechanisms. So it is conceivable that we then design drugs that would activate one or not the other. So, this is in the larger picture of trying to parse the relevant circuits that mediate specific symptoms of opiates. So for cor– for the opiates, the– the effect that we usually look for is to use them as painkillers. So, to reduce the pain that's yet in a different brain area but it is now important to see that we have additional two mechanisms that are involved and not one. And that will sort of give us new ideas on how to do selective new compounds that would basically do pain, to reduce the pain but not induce addiction. And it could also help us to better design substitution therapies, which is the cornerstone of opioid use disorder treatment. When people suffer from that they usually receive methadone, or in some countries, even heroin as a substitution drug. And now that we know how heroin and methadone activates these both circuits, we can improve those substitution therapies.Nick Petrić HoweAnd you know, you mentioned a couple of different opioids there. This study was about fentanyl, so do you think this sort of mechanism is broadly applicable to opioids?Christian LüscherYou're right, we need to formally test this. But from all we know, it's the exact same receptors that is activated, because when you take out the new receptors, all effects of the opiates are gone. And so, by extension, we are confident that this applies not only to fentanyl, but also to other opiates. The reason why we chose fentanyl is because it is a drug of public concern. But it is also a very rapidly active drug and that helps us to parse the effects. The faster a drug, the easier it is to see under experimental conditions.Nick Petrić HoweAnd you know, this study was in mice, what do you think needs to be done to translate this to humans?Christian LüscherWell, we know that these receptors and these brain circuits also exists in humans, and we can image them with functional technologies such as functional MRI, and I think our clinical colleagues now can use our sort of blueprint of what one has to look for, to confirm or not whether the same mechanisms apply to human people with addiction.Nick Petrić HoweThat was Christian Lüscher, from the University of Geneva, in Switzerland. For more on that story, including a link to Christian’s latest paper, published in Nature, check out the show notes.Lizzie Gibney Coming up, why babies are taking the South Korean government to court. Right now, though, it’s time for the Research Highlights, with Dan Fox.<music>Dan Fox The model of the blood-brain barrier made by combining two organoids could transform how scientists studied drug delivery to the brain. Organoids are groups of lab-grown cells that together form structures resembling an organ. By combining organoids, researchers can make ‘assembloids’ allowing them to study complex biological systems. In this case, a team wanted to learn more about the blood-brain barrier, the layer of cells that regulates which chemicals can pass from the bloodstream into the brain. To replicate the barrier, they combined blood vessel organoids with brain organoids. The blood vessels grew into the brain tissue creating networks of capillaries, and the team found that the same types of cell were present in the same places in both the ‘assembloid’ and the human blood-brain barrier. The researchers also created models using stem cells from people with a genetic disorder that causes the blood-brain barrier to fail. These yielded ‘assembloids’ that replicated the donors’ disease. Read that research in full in Cell Stem Cell.<music> Dan Fox An edible gel based on milk protein can both prevent and treat alcohol intoxication in mice. Harmful alcohol consumption leads to millions of deaths each year. And while treatments exist for severe intoxication, many of them need to be injected directly into a vein and provide only temporary relief from symptoms. Now, researchers have developed an alternative, by combining single iron atoms with nanometre-scale threads of a milk protein that is a by-product of cheesemaking. The team found that the gel could reduce alcohol levels in the blood of intoxicated mice and even prevent mice from becoming intoxicated in the first place. They say that their approach has potential for human use in a clinical setting. If you want to read that paper, you can find it in Nature Nanotechnology.<music> Lizzie Gibney Finally on the show, it’s time for the Briefing Chat where we discuss a couple of articles that have been featured in the Nature Briefing. Nick, what have you been reading about this time?Nick Petrić Howe Well, I've been reading about how babies are suing the South Korean government. And this was a story I was reading in Nature.Lizzie Gibney I'm so intrigued by this.Nick Petrić Howe Well, I should say it's not literally the babies taking the government to court is their parents using them as the plaintiff in this particular case. And it's about climate change. So, you've probably heard the various different climate change cases against governments for not doing their part or not doing enough in the view of those people to tackle climate change. And the idea is that for these younger folk it’s their futures that are being ruined. So, it may have a bit more of an effect on the government to say like, hey, you know, you're infringing on our human rights by not doing enough.Lizzie Gibney And is this somewhat unprecedented? Have babies taken people to court before?Nick Petrić Howe So, children across the world have actually taken governments to court. I think babies is quite unusual and, in this case, there's actually an unborn child as well who's one of the plaintiffs involved, obviously, again, it's the parents it's not literally the unborn child. But the idea, like I say, is that tackling climate change should protect future generations, and it's their– and it's their futures that will be affected if we don't do enough against climate change.Lizzie Gibney Yeah, it makes sense. What are the South Korean government doing or not doing that, you know, these families, including the babies want to happen?Nick Petrić Howe So currently, the South Korean government's targets are to reduce their emissions by 40% below their 2018 levels by 2030. Which sounds like a lot but if every country did that, that would still commit us to three degrees of warming by the end of the century. And you know, that's beyond the sort of limits that were agreed at Paris. And so, the argument here is that is insufficient, so they want to see more action. And this is done at a particular time as well, because this year, the Korean government will have to present their revised climate targets to the United Nations. And so, the people involved in this case, hope it will convince the government to, you know, be a bit more ambitious for the next 2035 target.Lizzie Gibney So, is this mostly a, you know, a public relations thing to get support for these kinds of changes to their targets? Or, you know, in the actual case, is there some kind of potential outcome that sees the government having to what I guess give a huge payout or something? Like what legally could happen if the families win?Nick Petrić Howe So, if there was a constitutional ruling that the South Korean government's targets were insufficient, they would have to enhance their climate ambition. So, there could be a very direct–Lizzie Gibney –it could force their hand to do something–Nick Petrić Howe –basically force their hand. And this has been seen, like across the world, as I said, like there have been other such cases, like in Switzerland, there was a famous one where similar things occurred. But the interesting thing about this one, as well, is this is the first case of its kind in East Asia — this really hasn't been done there. And the people involved are really hopeful that this will provoke more of these kinds of litigations against governments in East Asia, because really, we need everyone in the world involved. But in the past, in East Asia, people have seen litigation as a last resort, and this may make them reconsider how they use litigation.Lizzy Gibney We often think of with climate change, you know, there not been much we can do as an individual, but I guess this is one of the things you can do is sue your government.Nick Petrić Howe No, exactly, and the people involved in this case are quite optimistic as well. They say even if they lose this case, it's provoking a conversation is provoking social awareness and it could start change happening more and more.Lizzie Gibney Shall we talk about my story next?Nick Petrić Howe Yeah, let's do it. What have you been reading this week?Lizzie Gibney Well, it's literally my own story. Little bit cheeky. I bought my own story, so it's obviously by me in Nature. And this is about a new kind of nuclear power source, a heater based on the radioactive decay of an element called americium, which is actually a by-product of nuclear waste. And that's going on the European Space Agency's ExoMars mission, and Europe has never had its own one of these before. And no one's ever made one of these kind of nuclear heaters out of this particular element, americium, before either, so it's– it's a double first.Nick Petrić Howe Yeah, a lot of firsts going on here. But I guess, first of all, what is this heater going to be used for? Literally just heating the spacecraft? Or is there something more?Lizzie Gibney That right. So, it can get very, very cold in space, and to operate all kinds of components you need a heater. And this is very, very long lasting. That's the beauty of these radioactive decay-kind of heaters. So as the americium decays, it just releases heat. And in this case, it's actually going to be warming things within the landing platform. So, you have the kind of mothership that gets you out there to Mars, and then you have the lander comes out of that and lands and then that turns into a landing platform, that then ejects the rover out onto the surface. So that's the Rosalind Franklin rover. So there are going to be some similar kind of heaters made by NASA on the rover, but the ones made by Europe, these new pioneering ones are going to be on the landing platform itself. So it says slightly complimentary, it's not– it's not– it's not the big guns, they haven't put them yet on the rover, which is where they'd be really, really, really important. But they’re still doing an important job there on this landing platform. So they're keeping the landing platform going for much longer than it probably would do otherwise.Nick Petrić Howe And why would you need to have the landing platform I guess, sort of heated up? Mars is pretty cold, I gather, but what is the advantage?Lizzie Gibney Exactly, so it is cold there, so it will be going to Mars with its own batteries that only lasts a certain amount of time. This will keep the batteries warm and that means that the lander will have power for longer. So if there's a problem, say or there's some issue with unfurling the landing platform and getting the rover out, the rover derives all its power from the landing platform before it's deployed on the surface, and it gets out of solar panels. So this will mean basically that anything that goes wrong with the rover exiting out onto the surface, we have a little bit more of a window to save the mission. So it could turn out to be really important.Nick Petrić Howe And are there extra considerations they need to make sort of sending nuclear material into space? I mean, space missions are quite dangerous, at the best of time.Lizzie Gibney Hugely. So until now only NASA and Roscosmos, the Russian Space Agency have made these kinds of nuclear-powered heaters, and similar batteries. So, ESA is not quite ready to do the battery-kind where you turn the heat into electricity, but it's getting there as well. But so far, it's always been NASA or Russia. And they have made theirs from plutonium and they have supplied everyone else. So, in previous years, previous ESA missions, they've just use American or Russian heaters and batteries. What happened here with ExoMars, of course, is it was a collaboration with Russia. And then following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, that partnership was severed. And so, ESA has had to go back to the drawing board on a lot of fronts and figure out how to make this mission work. So, this is one tiny glimmer of opportunity in there and that they've said, okay, you know, what we're gonna do, we don't have the Russian heaters anymore, we're gonna use our own new pioneering type.Now, I realised I’ve gone off your question which was about how difficult is to make these and that is to say that very, very difficult, so they've only had plutonium ones up until now. And they require a huge amount of safety checks and certification before you can fly them. Obviously, what you're doing is effectively putting something radioactive on the top of a massive rocket, which is just another kind of fancy word for a bomb, really, and shooting it up into space. Okay, so they have to be really, really well encased so that they could withstand almost anything happening during launch. So those processes are going on right now. There's been some research teams that have been working on this since about 2009 on, you know there are so many different stages, how do we get this the americium, how do we get it? Well, it comes from nuclear waste, but can you take it out nuclear waste, and convert it into little kind of fuel pellets? You know, how do you do that? Then how do you build a device around it, because it's a lot, you get a lot less power for your gramme than you do with plutonium, which is what they've used till now. So, you need to just redesign the whole thing around that you need a bigger volume. So, they've been doing that. And then now we're in the kind of final stages, which is making sure it's all really safe. And so, this is going to launch in 2028. So, it feels like a long way off but I think it's gonna go in the blink of an eye, isn't it. So, they've probably got a lot of work to do.Nick Petrić Howe Well, hopefully we can come back in four years and see where it's at, then and hopefully all goes well for them.

47|Human body lice could harbor the plague and spread it through biting |"Study finds human body lice can transmit plague bacteria  In a recent study published in the journal PLOS Biology, researchers adapt a strain of human body lice to a membrane feeder to study its infection dynamics with Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of the plague. Study: Yersinia pestis can infect the Pawlowsky glands of human body lice and be transmitted by louse bite. Image Credit: PPK_studio / Shutterstock.comHuman body lice, otherwise known as Pediculus humanus humanus, are blood-feeding parasites that thrive in conditions of poor hygiene. They are known vectors for pathogens like Bartonella quintana, Borrelia recurrentis, and Rickettsia prowazekii; however, their role in transmitting Y. pestis is controversial.Although traditionally implicated fleas and rats are well-established vectors, recent studies suggest that human lice may also potentially transmit plague and, as a result, may have been involved in previous pandemics, including the Black Plague.Experimental evidence shows that lice can become infected with Y. pestis, especially at high bacteremia levels, and transmit the bacterium; however, their efficiency and survival rates post-infection are variable. Previous experiments have reported low transmission rates, whereas more recent studies using rabbit-adapted lice showed higher transmission but rapid louse mortality.Thus, further research is needed to clarify the role of body lice in plague transmission, including minimum infective doses, infection duration, and transmission mechanisms. To address this gap, researchers in the present study employed a standardized membrane feeder-adapted body louse model to evaluate the vector competence of lice for Y. pestis.The San Francisco strain of human body louse was used in the study. Direct and delayed transfer were both used to investigate body louse vector competence for Y. pestis. Lice infection rates, mortality, bacterial transmission, and fecal shedding were monitored for one week.Engineered strains of Y. pestis, Y. pseudotuberculosis, or Escherichia coli strains expressing mCherry were isolated on blood agar plates and cultured in brain-heart infusion broth. Fluorescence microscopy and immunohistochemistry (IHC) were used to investigate the colonization sites of Y. pestis in body lice and underlying transmission mechanisms.The transmission efficacies of the bacterium with different feeding periods ranging from three to 20 hours were determined and compared in Pawlowsky gland (PG)-infected and midgut-only infected lice. Varying infectious blood doses ranging from 104 to 107 colony-forming units (CFUs)/ml were used to simulate human bacteremia for analysis.The minimum bacteremia level required for chronic infection in body lice and PG colonization was determined. The infectivity and transmission potential of various bacterial strains, including Y. pestis and E. coli, were also examined in human body lice.The delayed transfer group showed higher but non-significant infection rates, mortality, and transmission rates. Both scenarios demonstrated that body lice could become chronically infected and effectively transmit Y. pestis, with their transmission efficiency remaining stable or improving by the seventh day despite Y. pestis-induced mortality.Three localization patterns of Y. pestis were observed in the lice: no detectable bacteria, bacteria only in the midgut, and bacteria in the head with or without midgut presence. About 14% of infected lice developed head infections in PGs, with these structures speculated to assist in mouthpart lubrication. Y. pestis was found in PGs and their ducts through IHC, thus supporting their role in transmitting the bacteria.Only lice with PG infections transmitted Y. pestis during the three-hour feeding period, with a median of 68 CFU recovered. Comparatively, during the 20-hour feeding assays, PG-infected lice consistently transmitted higher CFUs with a median of 2,000 CFU/louse compared to midgut-only lice.Post-assay, all PG-infected lice remained infected, as compared to only 75% of midgut-only lice. Y. pestis was found in the heads of all PG-infected lice, thus indicating that PG infection enhances transmission efficiency.A minimum bacteremia level of 1.2 x 105 CFU/ml was required for Y. pestis to reliably cause chronic infection in body lice with subsequent PG colonization. While chronic infection was observed at a rate of 58% at 108 CFU/ml, PG infection, and transmission occurred at bacteremia levels above or equal to 107 CFU/ml. Fecal transmission potential was observed even at low bacteremia.Chronic infection of the body louse midgut occurred within a range commonly noted in clinical case reports, whereas PG infection occurred at the upper range of human plague bacteremia. However, all tested bacterial strains could colonize body lice midguts; only Yersinia spp. could infect PGs. Infection and transmission rates were comparable among all bacterial strains.The current study provides strong evidence supporting the role of human body lice as potential vectors for plague transmission. With their larger blood intake, frequent feeding, and lack of key immunity genes, human body lice are efficiently infected by and transmit Y. pestis.Historical outbreaks, which correlate with peak rodent flea activity, indicate that body lice may have contributed significantly to the transmission of the plague under specific conditions. Thus, the study findings emphasize the importance of considering multiple vectors in formulating disease control strategies.Posted in: Medical Science News   Medical Research News   Disease/Infection NewsTags: Assay, Bacteria, Blood, Borrelia, Brain, Chronic, E. coli, Fluorescence, Fluorescence Microscopy, Genes, Heart, Hygiene, IHC, immunity, Immunohistochemistry, Membrane, Microscopy, Mortality, Plague, Research, RickettsiaWritten byDr. Sushama R.

48|Extreme heat will put millions more older adults at risk in the future|Extreme heat will put millions more older adults at risk in the future  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Acute heat exposures are expected to increase as temperatures and aging populations riseAn older man shields himself from the heat in Beijing in July of 2023. By mid-century, more adults age 69 and older will face extreme heat, especially those residing in Asia and Africa.Wang Zho/AFPBy Aimee CunninghamMay 14, 2024 at 11:00 amNearly a quarter of the global population of older adults at mid-century could face extreme heat, putting their health in danger.By 2050, as many as an additional 246 million adults age 69 and older could experience temperature extremes that exceed 37.5° Celsius, researchers report May 14 in Nature Communications. The new projection suggests that more than 23 percent of the global population of these older adults — largely concentrated in Africa and Asia — will encounter this intense heat, compared with 14 percent today.“Protecting our older population will be increasingly critical in the years to come,” says cardiologist-epidemiologist Andrew Chang of Stanford University and the University of California, San Fransisco, who was not involved with the research. “Older adults can be exquisitely vulnerable to the impacts of heat.”Exposure to hot temperatures is physiologically demanding, and there is a limit to how much heat the body can tolerate (SN: 8/6/2023; SN: 7/27/2022). Heat extremes are especially risky for older adults for many reasons. The aging body can’t cool off as efficiently. Older adults often have chronic illnesses that are worsened by heat, such as cardiovascular disease or diabetes. People in this age group commonly take medications that are dehydrating. And some older adults are socially isolated, are limited in their mobility or have cognitive impairments.“It’s this kind of perfect storm of biological aging, social loneliness and then cognition that make [heat] so much worse for older people,” says Deborah Carr, a sociologist of aging at Boston University.Carr and colleagues projected the population of those age 69 and up by 2050 and estimated the impact of climate change on the regions where these older adults will reside. The researchers assessed chronic heat exposure — prolonged exposure to uncomfortable heat — and acute exposures, which are short-lived but extreme, such as during a heat wave. The team found that chronic exposure, calculated by taking the average temperature across all days of a year and determining how many degrees each day exceed a threshold temperature of comfort, will increase worldwide by 2050.In terms of acute heat, there will be an increase worldwide in the number of days each year that exceed 37.5° C, from an average of 10 days to around 20. There will also be a greater upper bound to how high temperatures can reach during extreme heat, depending on the region. “Both the frequency and the intensity will increase as a result of climate change,” says Giacomo Falchetta, a climate change researcher at the Euro-Mediterranean Center on Climate Change in Venice, Italy.The team also looked at the contribution of the two factors, population aging and increasing heat, to understand which was driving the projected results depending on the region. In regions in the Global South, which have historically been hotter, a growing share of the population is aging. Regions in the Global North, which are “colder and older,” Carr says, “are experiencing more heat extremes.”There isn’t a one-size-fits-all approach to reduce the risks from increasing heat exposure to older adults, Falchetta says, but options include strengthening health care infrastructure, ensuring sufficient nutrition and hydration, implementing heat early warning systems, providing public cooling centers and expanding green spaces and tree cover to reduce urban heat island effects (SN: 4/3/2018).As for the study’s projections, there remains uncertainty on the climate, Falchetta says, depending on reductions in greenhouse gas emissions. Regarding the demographic changes, “these people have already been born — they are people like me,” he says. Countries need to “start planning now on how to accommodate the needs of those people in the future.”Questions or comments on this article?

49|Irregular bone marrow cells may increase heart disease risk|Irregular bone marrow cells may increase heart disease risk  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Genetic errors in bone marrow cells are passed to immune cells, which can ramp up inflammationIn the last decade, scientists have discovered that clonal hematopoiesis — when bone marrow stem cells acquire key genetic errors and pass them on to immune cells — is associated with an increased risk of developing cardiovascular disease. The Good Brigade/Getty ImagesBy Aimee CunninghamApril 26, 2024 at 7:00 amLowering blood pressure and cholesterol levels, quitting smoking, managing diabetes: these evidence-backed approaches remain key ways to reduce the risk of cardiovascular disease (SN: 11/9/15).But an unexpected contributor to that risk has emerged in the past decade. Nothing can be done to specifically tackle this risk factor yet, but the discovery offers a new angle to understanding cardiovascular disease. And it might partly explain why some people develop the disease even when they don’t check the familiar boxes on the modifiable risk list. A 2021 Lancet study found that of just over 62,000 people who had had serious heart attacks from 2005 to 2018, 15 percent did not smoke and did not have high cholesterol, high blood pressure or diabetes.The newly found risk arises from specialized cells, called stem cells, that live in the bone marrow. These cells can make copies of themselves or transform into blood and immune cells. Over time, the stem cells acquire genetic mistakes, giving some an edge in terms of self-renewal. Eventually, those stem cells can outnumber others in the bone marrow, providing more opportunities to pass the genetic errors on to blood and immune cells. This state, called clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential, or CHIP, is one step on the path to potentially developing blood cancer.But CHIP has also turned out to be linked to an increased risk of cardiovascular disease. And in terms of that risk, “it’s up there,” says Amy Lin, a cardiologist and physician-scientist at the University of California, San Fransisco. High blood pressure, excessive cholesterol and current or former smoking each increase the risk by a factor of 1.2 to 1.4, while CHIP ups the risk by a factor of almost 2. (Diabetes and older age, especially at 70 years and older, contribute even more to risk.)Studies of CHIP in animals suggest what may be going on in people’s bodies to boost risk. In mice, CHIP increases inflammation and accelerates the buildup of fat-laden plaques in arterial walls, a process called atherosclerosis, which can lead to a heart attack.As scientists develop a better understanding of its impact on inflammation and atherosclerosis, it’s possible that CHIP could be a target for treatment. “We‘ve got 10 [or] 15 years of really new science to do,” says cardiologist and physician-scientist Peter Libby of Brigham and Women’s Hospital and Harvard Medical School in Boston. Studying clonal hematopoiesis and how it influences the development of cardiovascular disease, Libby says, “is going to open up many many doors.”The genetic errors connected to CHIP are not inherited. Instead, these mutations pop up over time. “As we age, we get mutations,” says oncologist and physician-scientist Kelly Bolton of the Washington University School of Medicine in St. Louis. “It’s just by chance.” When this happens in particular genes in a bone marrow stem cell, “it can lead that cell to have an advantage” in its ability to renew itself. The copies have the errors, as do the blood or immune cells derived from these stem cells.Many people have CHIP by adulthood, “but it’s present at very low levels,” Bolton says. The degree of CHIP — and its overall prevalence — generally increases with age, as it can take time for a population of clones to grow. The larger the proportion of cells with errors in the genes tied to CHIP, the greater the risk of health issues, says Bolton. It’s a continuum.Of the genes connected to CHIP so far, those that are most commonly mutated regulate other genes or respond to genetic damage. It takes additional genetic errors beyond the ones that kick off CHIP to develop cancer. People can have CHIP and never get cancer.And it has turned out that there is more to CHIP than meets the eye. In 2014 in the New England Journal of Medicine, researchers reported on an analysis of DNA data from past studies totaling more than 5,000 people. The likelihood of dying from any cause was higher, by a factor of 1.4, for people with CHIP compared with people without it, over a period of roughly eight years. In a twist, “it wasn’t cancer-related deaths that people were dying of most often when they had CHIP,” says physician-scientist Siddhartha Jaiswal of the Stanford School of Medicine. “It was actually cardiovascular causes.”“That was interesting to us,” Jaiswal says. In a follow-up study published in 2017 in the same journal, Jaiswal and colleagues analyzed DNA data from past studies of people with and without coronary heart disease, which occurs when plaques form in the arteries that provide blood to the heart. People with CHIP had a risk of developing coronary heart disease almost two times as high as those without. Forty of the 443 with coronary heart disease had CHIP compared with 37 of the 577 without the disease.In the same study, Jaiswal and colleagues also investigated the impact of CHIP on mice bred to be more susceptible to developing plaques in their arteries. The mice received bone marrow transplants that either would or would not initiate CHIP. Then the mice were fed a high-cholesterol diet. The mice with CHIP had larger plaques and more inflammation compared with the mice without CHIP.Molecular biologist Ken Walsh of the University of Virginia School of Medicine in Charlottesville and his colleagues reported similar findings in their 2017 Science study on the impact of CHIP in atherosclerosis-prone mice. Walsh’s team’s work also nodded toward the possibility that something could be done about the increased risk of cardiovascular disease from CHIP. When the researchers blocked excessive inflammation that occurred in the CHIP mice, there was no longer a difference in the size of their plaques compared with the non-CHIP mice. “We could reverse the effect” that CHIP had on the development of atherosclerosis in the mice, Walsh says.Research over the last few decades has indicated that chronic inflammation is a risk factor for cardiovascular disease. In general, plaques start forming with the accumulation of “bad” cholesterol and immune cells in the arterial wall, including cells called macrophages that try to gobble up the cholesterol. Inflammation plays a role in the formation of the plaque, and as the plaque comes together, it kick-starts a series of cellular actions that further amplify inflammation.It looks like having CHIP adds even more inflammation, driven by the immune cells derived from the mutated stem cells. That’s suggested in the studies in mice, and in research on macrophages with errors in genes tied to CHIP, which has found the cells become “hyper-inflammatory,” Jaiswal says. “We think that having more immune cells in your blood vessel wall is bad. [CHIP] increases the amount of inflammation that the immune cells have. That leads to even more immune cells going to the area,” he says. “So it kind of just speeds the whole process” of plaque development.It might be possible to block extra inflammation that comes from CHIP in people. That hint came from a large clinical study that began before the link between CHIP and cardiovascular disease was reported. The trial enrolled more than 10,000 participants who previously had had a heart attack; some received one of three doses of a treatment that blocks an inflammatory protein. The participants on 150 mg of the treatment had a slight reduction, 15 percent, in the risk of developing another heart attack or stroke or dying from cardiovascular issues compared with those not on the treatment. There were close to four of these cardiovascular events per 100 people per year in the treated group versus 4.5 events per 100 per year in the group not given the treatment.However, the inflammatory protein targeted in the trial is also important for an effective immune response, and the treatment led to more fatal infections. In the end, the heart health benefit wasn’t enough to counter that infection risk. But when the clinical trial team learned of the effect of CHIP on cardiovascular disease, the group, which included Peter Libby, wondered: “If CHIP is involved in inflammation and we’ve got an anti-inflammatory, could we get a bigger bang in people who had CHIP?” Libby says.Although the clinical trial had concluded, the team had blood samples for nearly 4,000 participants. There were 338 with CHIP. Those who had errors in one of the main genes tied to CHIP, called TET2, had a 62 percent reduction in the risk of developing a heart attack or stroke or dying from cardiovascular issues, Libby and colleagues reported in 2022 in JAMA Cardiology. “Lo and behold,” Libby says, people with TET2 CHIP “had an outsized benefit” from the treatment.Figuring out how inflammation and CHIP are involved in cardiovascular disease “does not displace or demote” contributions from excessive cholesterol, high blood pressure or other modifiable risk factors, Libby says. “By no means do we think CHIP is the be–all and end–all or the only cause of atherosclerosis — it works together with the standard risk factors to boost your risk.”As of now, there isn’t a way to specifically temper CHIP’s impact on cardiovascular disease risk. So it would not be helpful for most people to learn whether they have CHIP. Nor is that testing widely available. CHIP tends to be discovered when people undergo genetic testing because they have cancer or symptoms suggestive of cancer. At this point, trying to prevent cardiovascular disease in those with CHIP relies on modifying the standard risk factors.Beyond the treatment potential, research into CHIP may also prove helpful in explaining two mysteries: why some people who don’t have the familiar risk contributors can still develop cardiovascular disease, and why the likelihood of developing the disease increases with age. “People have always thought that there’s still some sort of dark matter out there,” Walsh says. “So maybe what’s filling some of this void — some — is clonal hematopoiesis.”Questions or comments on this article?

50|A protein found in sweat may protect people from Lyme disease|"A protein found in human sweat may protect against Lyme disease   Suggestions or feedback?             Previous image Next image              Lyme disease, a bacterial infection transmitted by ticks, affects nearly half a million people in the United States every year. In most cases, antibiotics effectively clear the infection, but for some patients, symptoms linger for months or years.Researchers at MIT and the University of Helsinki have now discovered that human sweat contains a protein that can protect against Lyme disease. They also found that about one-third of the population carries a genetic variant of this protein that is associated with Lyme disease in genome-wide association studies.It’s unknown exactly how the protein inhibits the growth of the bacteria that cause Lyme disease, but the researchers hope to harness the protein’s protective abilities to create skin creams that could help prevent the disease, or to treat infections that don’t respond to antibiotics.“This protein may provide some protection from Lyme disease, and we think there are real implications here for a preventative and possibly a therapeutic based on this protein,” says Michal Caspi Tal, a principal research scientist in MIT’s Department of Biological Engineering and one of the senior authors of the new study.Hanna Ollila, a senior researcher at the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University of Helsinki and a researcher at the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard, is also a senior author of the paper, which appears today in Nature Communications. The paper’s lead author is Satu Strausz, a postdoc at the Institute for Molecular Medicine at the University of Helsinki.A surprising linkLyme disease is most often caused by a bacterium called Borrelia burgdorferi. In the United States, this bacterium is spread by ticks that are carried by mice, deer, and other animals. Symptoms include fever, headache, fatigue, and a distinctive bulls-eye rash.Most patients receive doxycycline, an antibiotic that usually clears up the infection. In some patients, however, symptoms such as fatigue, memory problems, sleep disruption, and body aches can persist for months or years.Tal and Ollila, who were postdocs together at Stanford University, began this study a few years ago in hopes of finding genetic markers of susceptibility to Lyme disease. To that end, they decided to run a genome-wide association study (GWAS) on a Finnish dataset that contains genome sequences for 410,000 people, along with detailed information on their medical histories.This dataset includes about 7,000 people who had been diagnosed with Lyme disease, allowing the researchers to look for genetic variants that were more frequently found in people who had had Lyme disease, compared with those who hadn’t.This analysis revealed three hits, including two found in immune molecules that had been previously linked with Lyme disease. However, their third hit was a complete surprise — a secretoglobin called SCGB1D2.Secretoglobins are a family of proteins found in tissues that line the lungs and other organs, where they play a role in immune responses to infection. The researchers discovered that this particular secretoglobin is produced primarily by cells in the sweat glands.To find out how this protein might influence Lyme disease, the researchers created normal and mutated versions of SCGB1D2 and exposed them to Borrelia burgdorferi grown in the lab. They found that the normal version of the protein significantly inhibited the growth of Borrelia burgdorferi. However, when they exposed bacteria to the mutated version, twice as much protein was required to suppress bacterial growth.The researchers then exposed bacteria to either the normal or mutated variant of SCGB1D2 and injected them into mice. Mice injected with the bacteria exposed to the mutant protein became infected with Lyme disease, but mice injected with bacteria exposed to the normal version of SCGB1D2 did not.“In the paper we show they stayed healthy until day 10, but we followed the mice for over a month, and they never got infected. This wasn’t a delay, this was a full stop. That was really exciting,” Tal says.Preventing infectionAfter the MIT and University of Helsinki researchers posted their initial findings on a preprint server, researchers in Estonia replicated the results of the genome-wide association study, using data from the Estonian Biobank. These data, from about 210,000 people, including 18,000 with Lyme disease, were later added to the final Nature Communications study.The researchers aren’t sure yet how SCGB1D2 inhibits bacterial growth, or why the variant is less effective. However, they did find that the variant causes a shift from the amino acid proline to leucine, which may interfere with the formation of a helix found in the normal version.They now plan to investigate whether applying the protein to the skin of mice, which do not naturally produce SCGB1D2, could prevent them from being infected by Borrelia burgdorferi. They also plan to explore the protein’s potential as a treatment for infections that don’t respond to antibiotics.“We have fantastic antibiotics that work for 90 percent of people, but in the 40 years we’ve known about Lyme disease, we have not budged that,” Tal says. “Ten percent of people don’t recover after having antibiotics, and there’s no treatment for them.”“This finding opens the door to a completely new approach to preventing Lyme disease in the first place, and it will be interesting to see if it could be useful for preventing other types of skin infections too,” says Kara Spiller, a professor of biomedical innovation in the School of Biomedical Engineering at Drexel University, who was not involved in the study.The researchers note that people who have the protective version of SCGB1D2 can still develop Lyme disease, and they should not assume that they won’t. One factor that may play a role is whether the person happens to be sweating when they’re bitten by a tick carrying Borrelia burgdorferi.SCGB1D2 is just one of 11 secretoglobin proteins produced by the human body, and Tal also plans to study what some of those other secretoglobins may be doing in the body, especially in the lungs, where many of them are found.“The thing I’m most excited about is this idea that secretoglobins might be a class of antimicrobial proteins that we haven’t thought about. As immunologists, we talk nonstop about immunoglobulins, but I had never heard of a secretoglobin before this popped up in our GWAS study. This is why it’s so fun for me now. I want to know what they all do,” she says.The research was funded, in part, by Emily and Malcolm Fairbairn, the Instrumentarium Science Foundation, the Academy of Finland, the Finnish Medical Foundation, the Younger Family, and the Bay Area Lyme Foundation.MIT researchers have discovered a protein found in human sweat that holds antimicrobial properties and can “inhibit the growth of the bacteria that causes Lyme disease,” reports Matt Fortin for NENC. The team believes this “type of protein could be put into a topical cream to make something called ‘Lyme Block’ – like sunblock, but for preventing Lyme.”  ""Ideally what we would love to do is give people more control over their own risk,"" says Principal Research Scientist Michal Tal. ""And really try to develop this into a possible preventative that you could put on repellant or sunblock to protect against other elements of the outdoors that you could also protect yourself against Lyme.""Researchers from MIT and elsewhere have isolated a “protein in human sweat that protects against Lyme disease,” reports Matthew Rozsa for Salon. The researchers believe that if “properly harnessed the protein could form the basis of skin creams that either prevent the disease or treat especially persistent infections,” writes Rosza.

52|Don’t use unsterilized tap water to rinse your sinuses. It may carry brain-eating amoebas|What to know about another dangerous amoeba linked to neti pots and nasal rinsing    Associated Press                       Associated Press                  Leave your feedbackNEW YORK (AP) — For years, scientists have known people who use neti pots can become infected with a brain-eating amoeba if they use the wrong kind of water. On Wednesday, researchers linked a second kind of deadly amoeba to nasal rinsing.WATCH: Why does it hurt to get water up your nose?The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention published a report that for the first time connects Acanthamoeba infections to neti pots and other nasal rinsing devices. Officials also renewed their warning that extremely rare, but potentially deadly, consequences can come from flushing nasal passages with common tap water.“We published this study because we want people to be aware of this risk,” said the CDC’s Dr. Julia Haston.Neti pots are one of the better known tools of nasal rinsing. They look like small teapots with long spouts, and usually are made of ceramic or plastic.Users fill them with a saline solution, then pour the liquid in one nostril. It comes out the other, draining the nasal passage of allergens and other bothersome contaminants.Neti pot use in the U.S. has boomed in the last couple of decades, driven in part by the increasing prevalence of allergies and other respiratory diseases, market researchers say.There also are other methods of rinsing nasal passages, including specially shaped cups and squeezable plastic bottles.Tap water in the U.S. is treated to meet safe drinking standards, but low levels of microscopic organisms can still be found in it. It’s usually not a problem when people drink or cook with the water, but it can pose more of a danger when tap water is used for other purposes — like in humidifiers or for nasal irrigation.CDC officials, citing a 2021 survey, say about one-third of U.S. adults incorrectly think tap water was free of bacteria and other microorganisms. Nearly two-thirds say tap water could be safely used for rinsing their sinuses.The CDC recommends using boiled, sterile or distilled water.If tap water is used, it must be boiled for a minimum of one minute — or three minutes at higher elevations — before it is cooled and used, officials say.More than a decade ago, health officials linked U.S. deaths from a brain-eating amoeba — named Naegleria fowleri — to nasal rinsing. More recently, they started to note nasal rinsing as a common theme in illnesses caused by another microscopic parasite, Acanthamoeba.Acanthamoeba causes different kinds of illness but is still dangerous, with a 85% fatality rate in reported cases.“These infections are very serious and even life threatening,” said Haston who was lead author of the report published in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases.The new study focused on 10 patients who fell ill between 1994 and 2022, three of whom died. Researchers say they can’t be sure how the patients were infected, but they noted several commonalities: All had weakened immune systems and practiced nasal rinsing.Seven patients reported nasal rinsing for relief of chronic sinus infections, and at least two of them used neti pots. Two other patients did nasal rinsing as part of a cleansing ritual that is part of Indian tradition.This amoeba can be found naturally all over the environment — in lakes, rivers, seawater and soil.It can cause diseases of the skin and sinuses, and can infect the brain, where it can cause a deadly form of inflammation. The microorganism also been connected to non-fatal, but sight-threatening, eye infections, sometimes through contaminated contact lens solution.U.S. health officials have identified about 180 infections from the single-cell organism since the first one was diagnosed in 1956.In the vast majority of cases, researcher don’t know exactly how people became infected. But in reviewing cases in recent decades, CDC researchers increasingly received information that a number of the cases had done nasal rinsing, Haston said.Research also has indicated it’s common in tap water. A study done in Ohio in the 1990s found more than half of tap water samples studied contained the amoeba and similar microorganisms. “It’s very likely that we’re all exposed to Acanthamoeba all the time,” she said.The Associated Press Health and Science Department receives support from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute’s Science and Educational Media Group.

53|The U.S. now has a drug for severe frostbite. How does it work?|The U.S. now has a drug for severe frostbite. How does it work?  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Approved by the FDA in February, iloprost can prevent the need to amputate frozen fingers and toesBundled in layers of warm clothing, a pedestrian in Minneapolis braves a day that was so bitterly cold that officials warned of a heightened risk of frostbite. A newly FDA-approved drug, iloprost, can help to treat severe frostbite.STEPHEN MATUREN/AFP via Getty ImagesBy Saugat BolakheMarch 12, 2024 at 9:00 amIn the worst cases, frostbite can cause the tissues in fingers, toes, noses and other extremities to die and require amputation. Now doctors in the United States have a way to save patients from these life-altering effects.In February, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved the country’s first medication to treat severe frostbite. In a clinical trial, the drug, iloprost, greatly reduced amputations in nearly all the frostbite patients who received it.Although frostbite affects a relatively small number of people in the United States — a few thousand annually — it is a major concern for people who must spend a lot of time outside in the cold, such as mountain climbers, people in the military and people without housing.A synthetic drug first developed in Germany in 1980s, iloprost, also known by the brand name Aurlumyn, is given by injection. It works as a vasodilator, meaning it widens blood vessels, improves blood flow and prevents risk of blood clotting. It was primarily used to treat Raynaud’s disease, a disorder that causes blood vessels in the fingers and toes to narrow, as well as to treat blood pressure–related illnesses.A study published in 1994 was the first to test if the drug may also be able to open up jammed blood vessels as a result of frostbite. It was tested in five patients, successfully recovering their frostbitten digits in all cases.The drug subsequently showed promising results in studies done in England, France and Nepal. In the clinical trial cited by the FDA in its approval of iloprost, patients rescued from high altitudes were randomly assigned to treatment with either buflomedil (another vasodilator), iloprost or iloprost plus a drug that breaks down blood clots. Out of the 47 patients treated over 12 years, none of the 16 patients that received iloprost alone had to have digits amputated, researchers reported in 2011 in the New England Journal of Medicine. In comparison, nine of 15 patients in the buflomedil group needed amputations as did three of 16 patients in the iloprost combination group.Iloprost is already an approved treatment for frostbite for years in a number of European countries and elsewhere in the world. Science News talked with Chris Imray, a vascular surgeon at University Hospitals Coventry & Warwickshire in England who has been treating patients with this drug for more than a decade, about what frostbite does to the body, how the drug works and what it will mean for patient treatment in the United States. The interview has been edited for length and clarity.SN: What happens in the body during frostbite?Imray: Frostbite is a thermal injury that affects [the] hands, feet, nose, ears and occasionally external genitalia after a few hours of cold exposure. When the temperature of the tissue drops to around zero degree Celsius, the blood flow through the tissue slows down. Then you get thrombosis, clots forming within the blood vessels, which subsequently leads to loss of oxygen delivery to the tissue. Over a period of time, you then get gangrene and the tissue dies.SN: How did scientists realize that targeting blood clotting can be useful in frostbite treatment?Imray: If we’ve got a tissue that’s damaged from a thermal injury with poor blood supply, you could try to treat by warming the tissue. But the problem is that if there’s no blood supply, you may warm up the tissue but you won’t restore the oxygen delivery to the tissue, and that actually just speeds up the deterioration.We’ve known for some time in other situations, like stroke or acute coronary syndromes, that if you can restore the blood quickly, within four to six hours, you can restore the blood supply, clear the clots in the small blood vessels, and then oxygen is delivered to the tissues again. One of the treatments for acute coronary syndrome was thrombolytic agents to break down the clot. But if a patient had an accident and has soft tissue or bony injuries, giving them thrombolytic agents may cause more bleeding. Iloprost works as a vasodilator rather than as a lytic agent on the clot. That’s really sort of where it came from.SN: How has iloprost changed treatment of frostbite?Imray: We used to do something called a sympathectomy. Vascular surgeons would cut the sympathetic nerves to open up the blood vessels to the hands or to the feet. Once [iloprost] came out, it seemed to have a similar effect — it would cause the blood vessels to vasodilate. The beauty was you didn’t have to cut the nerves permanently.SN: How is iloprost administered?Imray: The drug is given intravenously and circulates all through the body. We often start at a low dose and then gradually increase the infusion rate, until the patient starts to get side effects — facial flushing, high heart rate or low blood pressure. At that point, we wind it back a very small amount — just enough to get rid of the symptoms. Then we run it for six hours [and repeat] the process for around five days. We can do imaging tests to see if there’s an improvement to the blood supply to the tissues. Then the surgeons will need to manage the tissues that have been almost dead and brought back to life. The overall effect is a dramatic limb and digit salvage rate, which is quite remarkable.SN: How does iloprost work?There are multiple mechanisms that have been put forward for it. One is vasodilation. One is that it seems to affect clotting slightly. And it changes the [ability] of the red blood cells to get through the small vessels.SN: What timing is crucial for treating frostbite?Imray: All tissues have different metabolic rates. The brain has a very high metabolic rate, which is why [there’s] a short window, about six hours, to [break down blood clots] in a stroke. The heart has a little bit longer. And if you don’t get there within that time, the person has permanent tissue damage.We’re not really sure about tissues in the hands, feet and muscles. We thought [within] 24 hours was the maximum time [after frostbite injury for using iloprost], but there have been reports of some people who have gone as long as five days. But the longer you go for the type of injury, the less impressive the effects will be.SN: Who will this new approval benefit most?Imray: We’ve had a number of high-profile climbers who have had [frostbite] injuries where they’ve been told there’s nothing that can be done. And they subsequently lost tissue. So, what we’re trying to do is to identify medical units [close to the big mountains] where iloprost can be given, so that if you have an injury, you can be flown there as quickly as possible.Frostbite also affects homeless people. Sadly, they don’t generate the same concern [as the high-profile climbers], but they can have serious frostbite injuries and end up with life-changing amputations.If you look at people who would be at risk of losing limbs, [the iloprost approval] will transform that. I’m delighted [the FDA has] approved it, but they’ve taken quite a long time to get there.Questions or comments on this article?

54|More than 1 billion people worldwide are now estimated to have obesity|More than 1 billion people worldwide are now estimated to have obesity  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The chronic disease affects roughly one-eighth of the global populationThe global prevalence of obesity has soared over the last 30 years. A new analysis suggests that more than 1 billion people worldwide now live with the chronic disease.miljko/Getty ImagesBy McKenzie PrillamanFebruary 29, 2024 at 6:30 pmIt’s no secret that global obesity rates have been rising over the past few decades. But a new analysis quantifies the upsurge.More than 1 billion people worldwide were living with obesity as of 2022, researchers report February 29 in the Lancet. That’s about one-eighth of the global population (SN: 11/15/22). For comparison, nearly 800 million people had obesity in 2016, according to the World Health Organization, or WHO.Obesity is “defined by the presence of excess body fat that impairs health,” says obesity expert Arya Sharma of the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, who was not involved in the study. The chronic disease can raise the risk for conditions like heart disease and type 2 diabetes, vulnerability to diseases like COVID-19, and can also limit mobility and negatively affect mental health (SN: 4/22/20).Global health researcher Majid Ezzati and colleagues examined more than 3,600 population-based studies published over the last several decades encompassing 222 million participants across nearly 200 countries and territories. The researchers divided each participant’s reported weight by their height squared to find their body mass index, or BMI.Analyzing the trends suggested that in 2022, almost 900 million adults worldwide had a BMI of 30 or above, classifying them as having obesity. In children and adolescents ages 5 to 19, nearly 160 million were estimated to have the chronic disease, defined as BMI above a certain point on the WHO’s growth reference curves, which account for age and sex.From 1990 to 2022, the prevalence of obesity roughly doubled in women, tripled in men and quadrupled in children and adolescents. At the same time, global rates of those who were underweight fell. “We shouldn’t be thinking about [underweight and obesity] as two separate things, because the transition from one to the other has been very rapid,” says Ezzati, of Imperial College London.The estimated obesity rates should raise alarms, he says. “Governments and societies need to deal with this” through prevention and medical care. Despite new anti-obesity medications like Wegovy showing incredible results, Ezzati adds, their high costs and lack of incorporation in worldwide medical guidance will make them inaccessible to most people for the near future (SN: 12/13/23).Ezzati notes that one of the biggest driving factors of obesity’s increased prevalence is limited access to and the unaffordability of healthy foods. Sharma adds that societal-level lifestyle changes — such as getting less sleep, increased stress levels and spending less time at home — can also lead to eating more processed foods and overconsumption (SN: 12/21/18; SN: 5/16/19).“When you look at appetite, there’s a complex biology behind it,” Sharma says. “And that biology is affected by environmental changes.”Questions or comments on this article?

55|Snake venom toxins can be neutralized by a new synthetic antibody|Snake venom toxins can be neutralized by a new synthetic antibody  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Lab-made antibodies could be the answer to deadly snakebites Toxins in the venom of black mambas (one shown) and certain other snakes can paralyze snakebite victims. A lab-made antibody that targets these toxins could be a step toward a universal antivenom.suebg1 photography/Moment/Getty Images PlusBy Meghan RosenFebruary 27, 2024 at 8:15 amThe antivenom for a black mamba’s bite could one day work for a slew of other snakes. Scientists have developed an antibody that shuts down paralyzing toxins in the venom of black mambas, king cobras and dozens of other sharp-toothed serpents. The antibody — a single protein manufactured in the lab — protected mice from otherwise lethal doses of venom, protein engineer Joseph Jardine and colleagues report in the Feb. 21 Science Translational Medicine. That antibody “will be a critical component of an eventual antivenom,” says Jardine, of the Scripps Research Institute in La Jolla, Calif.Venomous snakes generally rely on just a handful of toxin families. If scientists could mix together antibodies targeting each of those types, Jardine says, they could potentially create “one vial of antivenom that works against any snake in the world.” Such a universal antivenom might still be many years away, he says. But “theoretically, this is possible.”Scientists have tallied hundreds of venomous snake species across the globe. In North America, a person might stumble upon a western diamondback; in Africa, a puff adder; in South Asia, a saw-scaled viper. A bite from any one of these snakes can maim or kill. Venomous snakebites kill up to about 140,000 people each year, according to the World Health Organization. Lifesaving antivenoms exist, Jardine says, but they’re “built with 100-year-old technology.” That technology involves injecting animals like horses or sheep with snake venom and harvesting the venom-targeting antibodies that their immune systems churn out. A snakebit patient would then get an infusion of horse or sheep antibodies — if doctors have them in stock. The process has major drawbacks, Jardine says. Each animal produces antibodies for just one type of venom. Currently, bites from a yellow-bellied sea snake, cottonmouth or inland Taipan would all require different treatments. Another issue is the health effects of the antivenom itself. “You’re putting a whole bunch of horse antibodies into a person,” Jardine says. People can get sick or even go into anaphylactic shock. His team’s approach could glide past those problems. In a collection of more than 60 billion lab-made antibodies, the team hunted for ones that target a particularly vicious venom component used by some snakes: long-chain three-finger alpha-neurotoxins. These molecules look like a small hand with three fingers, says biotechnologist Andreas H. Laustsen-Kiel of the Technical University of Denmark in Kongens Lyngby. When delivered into a person’s bloodstream via snakebite, the hand literally gives victims the finger. The toxin’s middle finger pokes into a protein needed for movement, shutting down muscles and paralyzing the body. Antibodies that grasp the finger can block its toxic touch, Laustsen-Kiel says. Last year, his group reported several new antibodies, including a human antibody that neutralizes three-finger toxins like the one in Jardine’s study. But the new antibody “looks like it’s even better than ours,” Laustsen-Kiel says. It appears to grab a wider array of toxins and with a tighter grip, he says. In mice given venom from a black mamba and an Indian spitting cobra, injecting the antibody saved the rodents’ lives, Jardine’s team reports. The researchers are now working to develop antibodies that target other venom toxins. Still, the idea of creating a single, universal antivenom may not be entirely realistic, Laustsen-Kiel says. “It simply doesn’t make sense from a product perspective,” he says. Instead, Laustsen-Kiel envisions antivenoms that are tailored for use in specific regions. Whatever the formulation of these future antivenoms, research on snakebites — considered a neglected tropical disease — is underfunded, Jardine says (SN: 9/19/20). Though millions of cases occur in rural India and Africa, there’s relatively little money available for improving treatments, he says. (Jardine has funding from the London-based global health charity the Wellcome Trust.) Snakebites just aren’t considered a medical priority, Jardine says. But for people whose families and livelihoods depend on their ability to farm, he says, losing life or limb to snakebite is devastating.Questions or comments on this article?

56|Taking a weight-loss drug reduced a craving for opioids|Opioid cravings were reduced by anti-obesity drug in small study   Home Don't miss outSubscribe to STAT+ today, for the best life sciences journalism in the industryBy Simar BajajFeb. 17, 2024DENVER — The GLP-1 medication liraglutide significantly reduced opioid cravings in a small analysis presented on Saturday. It is the first randomized controlled trial to test anti-obesity drugs against opioid addiction, which kills around 80,000 people in the U.S. each year.Among 20 patients for opioid use disorder, those on liraglutide experienced a 40% reduction in opioid cravings over the three-week study, with this effect evident at even the lowest liraglutide dose, according to data presented here at the American Association for the Advancement of Science conference.advertisementAmong patients already on buprenorphine, a medication approved by the FDA to treat opioid use disorder, those also on liraglutide were more likely to report zero cravings than the placebo group. This effect became statistically significant from the tenth day of the study onward, as patients were titrated to increasingly higher doses of liraglutide. “It suggests there’s an additive effect of these two medications,” said Andrew Saxon, an addiction psychiatrist at the University of Washington who was not involved with this study, potentially because liraglutide and buprenorphine target different mechanisms.Understand how science, health policy, and medicine shape the world every dayFor the most part, there were no notable differences in side effects between patients on liraglutide and those on placebo, suggesting that this GLP-1 drug is safe in patients with opioid use disorder. Gastrointestinal distress, however, was twice as common in the liraglutide group and largely responsible for the study’s high dropout rate, with only nine patients completing the three-week trial.However, Scott Bunce, a clinical psychologist at Penn State and one of the trial’s principal investigators, noted that patients who received both liraglutide and buprenorphine had lower GI distress and dropout rates than participants on liraglutide alone, suggesting that the combination approach could alleviate some of these issues. Furthermore, the finding that cravings were significantly reduced at the lowest liraglutide dose suggests that many of these side effects could be mitigated by maintaining a low dose, although this merits further study.advertisementThe study was conducted at the Caron Treatment Center in Wernersville, Pa., and funded by the National Institute on Drug Abuse, a donor family, and the pharma company Novo Nordisk, which sells liraglutide as Victoza for diabetes and Saxenda for obesity. The patients were all residential, having just undergone medication-assisted withdrawal.About 80% of participants were white men, and everyone received a notification on their phones four times a day to assess self-reported cravings. “That allowed us to ask people how much they’re craving in the moment — not yesterday, not last week,” said Patricia Grigson, director of the Penn State Addiction Center for Translation and the trial’s other PI.This clinical trial is the culmination of seven years of animal studies in Grigson’s lab, showing that GLP-1s target three roads to relapse — environmental cues, stress, and the drug itself — as STAT has previously reported. While the FDA has approved three drugs for treating opioid addiction, a recent study from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and National Institutes of Health estimated that only 20% of patients received these medications in 2021.Beyond low uptake, these drugs are associated with significant relapse rates (around 50%), don’t work as well in patients who have used fentanyl, and, in the case of buprenorphine and methadone, are sometimes stigmatized as opioids replacing opioids. GLP-1s could thus be a promising alternative or, at the very least, an adjunct to existing treatments, Grigson and Bunce said.However, the small sample size, limited participant diversity, and relatively short trial means that “we have to be very cautious about interpreting these preliminary results,” said Heath Schmidt, a neuropharmacologist at the University of Pennsylvania who was not involved with this study. An added limitation is that studying patients in a residential treatment facility might not be representative: “That’s very different than being at home or on the street, where you’re around a lot of cues that promote relapse and craving,” Schmidt added. Moreover, people in a treatment facility are likely a highly motivated subset of patients, more inclined toward treatment.But perhaps the most significant limitation of these data is the high dropout rate, which not only limits interpretation of the results but also highlights a potential barrier of using GLP-1s to treat drug addiction. “Nausea is one of the first withdrawal symptoms — and this patient population is severely anxious and fearful about withdrawal,” said Saxon. “So they could interpret nausea as ‘I’m getting into withdrawal, and I’ve got to get away from it, however I can.’ ”Despite these limitations, Christian Hendershot, a University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill psychologist who has been studying GLP-1s for alcohol use disorder and was not involved with the study, emphasized the importance of this data as a proof of concept and a stepping stone toward larger trials. “The reason these initial findings are nice is that they looked at this question in a really controlled environment,” said Hendershot. “We know that craving predicts relapses in many cases, so having established that reduction, the next question is whether drugs like liraglutide suppress craving and relapse in the natural environment.”Grigson and Bunce similarly emphasize the preliminary nature of their findings and the need for follow-up studies. They are planning a randomized controlled trial in 200 people on methadone or buprenorphine, half receiving semaglutide and half receiving placebo — across three outpatient sites in Pennsylvania, New York, and Maryland.“With one person dying every five minutes and people dying around the world due to opioid exposure, we feel a sense of urgency,” Grigson said. “I feel very hopeful; there may be a new treatment for opioid use disorder.”Clarification: Participants using liraglutide experienced a 40% reduction in opioid cravings in the study (as the researchers showed in a slide), not 30% reduction (as stated in the presentation).STAT’s coverage of chronic health issues is supported by a grant from Bloomberg Philanthropies.

57|A new device let a man sense temperature with his prosthetic hand|A new device let a man sense temperature with his prosthetic hand  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Ability to differentiate between cold, cool and hot objects advances efforts to restore touchA sensor on the index finger of a man’s prosthetic hand connects to a spot on his arm that stimulates nerves once destined for the missing limb. The device made it possible for him to ace a sorting task: separate as many stainless steel blocks that are either cold (20° Celsius) or hot (40° C) as he could in one minute.Jamani Caillet/EPFLBy Simon MakinFebruary 9, 2024 at 11:00 amA new device makes it possible for a person with an amputation to sense temperature with a prosthetic hand. The technology is a step toward prosthetic limbs that restore a full range of senses, improving both their usefulness and acceptance by those who wear them.  A team of researchers in Italy and Switzerland attached the device, called ”MiniTouch,” to the prosthetic hand of a 57-year-old man named Fabrizio, who has an above-the-wrist amputation. In tests, the man could identify cold, cool and hot bottles of liquid with perfect accuracy; tell the difference between plastic, glass and copper significantly better than chance; and sort steel blocks by temperature with around 75 percent accuracy, researchers report February 9 in Med.“It’s important to incorporate these technologies in a way that prosthesis users can actually use to perform functional tasks,” says neuroengineer Luke Osborn of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel, Md., who was not involved in the study. “Introducing new sensory feedback modalities could help give users more functionality they weren’t able to achieve before.”The device also improved Fabrizio’s ability to tell whether he was touching an artificial or human arm. His accuracy was 80 percent with the device turned on, compared with 60 percent with it off. “It’s not quite as good as with the intact hand, probably because we’re not giving [information about] skin textures,” says neuroengineer Solaiman Shokur of EPFL, the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Lausanne.Work to restore a sense of touch to prosthetic limbs has advanced greatly over the past decade (SN: 9/9/19). But the ability to detect temperature has lagged behind. “Temperature is almost the last modality that needs to be solved in order to then put all the results together and be able to make an artificial limb really feel as the biological one,” says EPFL engineer Jonathan Muheim.The study builds on work the group published last May, which found that people who have had amputations often have spots on their residual limbs that, when heated or cooled, generate temperature sensations in their missing hand. It’s caused by stimulating nerves originally destined for the missing hand. The researchers showed they could reliably elicit phantom temperature sensations over time in 63 percent of amputees.In the new study, Shokur, Muheim and colleagues first mapped Fabrizio’s phantom temperature sensations to match a spot on his arm to the corresponding sensation in the index finger of his missing hand. They then attached a temperature sensor to the fingertip of his prosthetic hand, which was connected via a controller unit to a device on Fabrizio’s arm that delivered appropriate temperature signals.Currently the device employs only one sensor at the end of the index finger, but the team plans to add sensor-stimulator pairs to create more temperature-sensitive locations on the prosthetic hand. They are also planning to develop a prosthesis that combines the ability to sense touch as well as temperature. “In the coming year or so, hopefully that’s where we’ll be,” says Shokur.The speed at which the device relays temperature may become an issue when combining multiple senses. Osborn and colleagues have developed a device as thin as a Band-Aid that delivers realistic cooling sensations nearly as quickly as natural responses, that team reported in Nature Biomedical Engineering last July. In the immediate term, the new device needs to be tested in larger groups of participants, as well as real world settings, to ensure it isn’t adversely affected by high air temperatures or humidity. “We still need to do those crash tests outside the lab,” says Shokur.Once it leaves the lab, Fabrizio already knows how he’d put it to use. “With these new technologies, I can understand better what I am touching,” Fabrizio said in a prerecorded video interview. “Certainly, my priority would be to use it in a kitchen to cook.”Questions or comments on this article?

58|Evolutionary virologist Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks out ancient pathogens|Evolutionary virologist Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks out ancient pathogens  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	He has reconstructed two viruses brought to the Americas during European colonizationDaniel Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school. Today he studies how they’ve shaped human evolution and history.Courtesy of D. Blanco-MeloBy Pratik PawarNovember 14, 2023 at 9:00 amSmallpox, measles, mumps. These are among the contagious diseases that European colonists likely brought to the Americas at the turn of the 16th century, prompting the collapse of Indigenous populations. But the exact viruses that caused the millions of deaths remain unknown.Daniel Blanco-Melo seeks to solve that historical puzzle. An evolutionary virologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Center in Seattle, he uses cutting-edge tools to study ancient viruses and illuminate how they have shaped human evolution and history. In recent work, Blanco-Melo and colleagues reconstructed two viruses circulating in Mexico at the time of European colonization.“Our research on ancient viruses is really appealing to the curiosity of the people and how we can study history,” Blanco-Melo says. But this work also holds personal meaning for Blanco-Melo as someone who was born and raised in Mexico. Through genetic sleuthing, he is able to study “something that is very dear in my heart,” he says, “really understanding, with molecular biology, those historical events.”Blanco-Melo’s obsession with viruses bloomed in high school when he had a chance encounter with Matt Ridley’s book Genome. Blanco-Melo had bought it as a Father’s Day gift for his dad but ended up reading it himself. Later, with encouragement from his biology teacher, he enrolled in an undergraduate program in genomics at the National Autonomous University of Mexico, or UNAM, campus in Cuernavaca.He had his first encounter with ancient viruses as a Ph.D. student at the Rockefeller University in New York City. His research focused on particular viruses called endogenous retroviruses, remnants of past infectious viruses that have become integrated into a host’s genetic instruction book.Blanco-Melo first cataloged the genetic remains left behind by an ancient retrovirus called HERV-T that spread among our primate ancestors tens of millions of years ago. Further analysis revealed that a gene responsible for producing the virus’s outer envelope stuck around throughout primate history; even modern humans retain an inactive version. This gene encodes the envelope protein that helps the virus enter and infect a cell by interacting with another protein on the cell surface.Why would such a viral gene be so well preserved, Blanco-Melo wondered. What kind of evolutionary advantage could it have offered? Based on studies of cells in a lab dish, he hypothesizes that ancient primates must have co-opted the viral gene and used the related protein to get rid of the cell surface protein, essentially blocking the virus’s entry into cells.This example highlights how a virus’s own genetic material, over the course of evolution, can be used against it. “This project not only satisfied my curiosity, but we were able to push it into a full-blown story of how a virus evolved, emerged, but also how that virus ceased to exist,” Blanco-Melo says.Perhaps today’s researchers can exploit similar strategies to combat current retroviruses — “the big goal being HIV,” Blanco-Melo says.More recently, Blanco-Melo has teamed up with María Ávila-Arcos, an evolutionary geneticist at UNAM and an old friend, to study viral epidemics that largely wiped out Indigenous populations in the Americas.Blanco-Melo, Ávila-Arcos and a team of researchers extracted and isolated viral DNA from skeletal remains that they dated to somewhere between the 15th and 17th centuries. These remains come from mass graves at a colonial hospital and a chapel in what is now Mexico City. Archaeological and hospital autopsy records suggest that the remains in the graves belonged to Indigenous people and enslaved Africans who were victims of epidemics that occurred during the 1540s and 1570s.Based on those findings, the team reconstructed the genetic instruction books of two viruses not previously known to be circulating at that time — human parvovirus B19 and a human hepatitis B virus.The study, published in 2021 in the journal eLife, is perhaps the first to obtain ancient viral sequences from the Americas, says Jesse Bloom, a virologist at the Fred Hutch who wasn’t involved in this work.“Knowing about the ancient viruses that were infecting people hundreds of years ago is of great scientific and historical interest throughout the world, but especially of interest in the Americas,” Bloom says.The team found that the ancient viruses were similar to contemporary African strains. They “seem to have arrived in Mexico shortly after the European arrival,” Blanco-Melo says, “but they did not come from Europe. They came from Africa, basically through the transatlantic slave trade.”Through the collaboration, Blanco-Melo has been careful to avoid helicopter research, where outsiders come to a place, get the data and take credit for the resulting work. “These samples should stay in Mexico, should be analyzed by Mexican researchers … and all those results are, of course, going to be communicated back into the communities. That’s our goal,” he says.Though the two viruses the team identified aren’t likely to have caused massive epidemics, they could have exacerbated some of the symptoms of other diseases. Ongoing projects based on the same samples from Mexico are looking for other viruses and even peptides to get a fuller picture of the viruses from that time — and perhaps pin down big culprits. “There’s a lot more research that needs to be done in order to capture those other causative agents,” Blanco-Melo says.Questions or comments on this article?

59|Newly identified stem cells can lure breast cancer to the spine|Newly identified stem cells can lure breast cancer to the spine  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	Stem cells in the vertebrae secrete a protein that acts as a tumor attractorScientists have discovered a new type of stem cell that forms spinal tissue (in mice, these stem cells and the cells they produce are shown in green).J. Sun et al./Nature 2023By Meghan RosenOctober 13, 2023 at 11:00 amWhen breast cancer spreads, it often targets the spine. Now scientists may have finally discovered why.A newfound kind of stem cell drives cancer cells to bones in the vertebrae, pathologist Matthew Greenblatt of Weill Cornell Medicine in New York City and his colleagues report September 13 in Nature. The find helps explain a long-standing mystery of metastasis: why some cancers break away from their site of origin, journey through the bloodstream and take up residence in the backbone.“This is a major advance in our understanding of bone metastasis,” says Xiang Zhang, a cancer biologist at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston who was not involved with the new study.In people with metastatic breast cancer, some 70 percent experience subsequent bone cancer. And of the bones in the skeleton, cancer cells preferentially seek out vertebrae. For these patients, “spine metastases are one of the most common complications,” Greenblatt says, “and one of the most dreaded.” Tumors that take root in the spine can crush the spinal cord, which houses nerve bundles crucial for body sensation and movement. Such damage can hamper people’s ability to walk and control their bladder and bowels, and shorten their life spans.Doctors have known for decades that some cancers preferentially seek out the spine, Greenblatt says, but no one has had a good explanation for why. One idea proposed in 1940, that actions like coughing jolt blood off course and somehow send cancerous cells to the vertebrae, still hangs on today. It’s what Greenblatt learned when he was a medical student. But for him and his team, “that didn’t make sense to us scientifically.”What did end up making sense was stem cells. The researchers had a hunch that stem cells inside vertebral bones differed from those in other sites in the skeleton, like the long bones in the arms and legs. In the lab, that’s just what they found. Greenblatt’s team pulled out a population of stem cells from mice vertebrae distinctly unlike ones collected from long bones. These new stem cells switched on a separate set of genes and behaved differently in experiments, the researchers found.Until now, scientists didn’t know that these two types of bones held distinct populations of stem cells. “We assumed they were the same,” says Geert Carmeliet, a cell and molecular endocrinologist at KU Leuven in Belgium who was not involved with the work, but wrote an accompanying commentary. The team’s discovery raised the possibility that spinal stem cells might play a role in spinal disease.In one key experiment, Greenblatt’s team transplanted spinal stem cells into one hind leg of mice and long bone stem cells into the other. Each transplant formed miniature bones, or organoids, in the animals’ bodies — a tiny vertebra on the right, for example, and a bit of long bone on the left. Then, the researchers injected breast cancer cells into the mice and watched where they ended up.The cells traveled to the mini vertebra nearly twice as often as they did to the little long bone, as if lured by a cancer-calling Pied Piper. It’s an elegant way to show that “tumor cells preferentially come to the [vertebra] organoid and not to the organoid of the long bone,” Carmeliet says.The newly identified spinal stem cells, found in both mice and humans, secrete a protein called MFGE8 that acts as a tumor attractant, the team discovered, drawing cancer cells to spinal tissue. The protein may not be the only factor involved, Greenblatt says, “but it’s an important one in driving tumor cells to the spine.”It’s possible that blocking MFGE8 could prevent or treat spine metastasis. “I think it’s definitely worth further investigation,” Zhang says. But, he notes, it’s still too early to know what the therapeutic implications may be.Greenblatt’s team is now exploring whether the new stem cells can recruit other types of tumor cells to the spine. When prostate cancer spreads, for example, it also tends to travel to vertebrae over other types of bone. He and his colleagues are also curious whether our bones may be hiding anything else. “We’re starting to think about what other stem cells may be left to discover in the skeleton.”Questions or comments on this article?

Small tunnels (small, blue vertical lines, lower right) also connect this layer to the skull.Z.I. Kolabas et al/Cell 2023By Claudia López LloredaSeptember 5, 2023 at 11:00 amCells hidden in the skull may point to a way to detect, diagnose and treat inflamed brains.A detailed look at the skull reveals that bone marrow cells there change and are recruited to the brain after injury, possibly traveling through tiny channels connecting the skull and the outer protective layer of the brain. Paired with the discovery that inflammation in the skull is disease-specific, these new findings collectively suggest the skull’s marrow could serve as a target to track and potentially treat neurological disorders involving brain inflammation, researchers report August 9 in Cell.Immune cells that infiltrate the central nervous system during many diseases and neuronal injury can wreak havoc by flooding the brain with damaging molecules. This influx of immune cells causes inflammation in the brain and spinal cord and can contribute to diseases like multiple sclerosis (SN: 11/26/19). Detecting and dampening this reaction has been an extensive field of research.With this new work, the skull, “something that has been considered as just protective, suddenly becomes a very active site of interaction with the brain, not only responding to brain diseases, but also changing itself in response to brain diseases,” says Gerd Meyer zu Hörste, a neurologist at University of Münster in Germany who was not involved in the study.Ali Ertürk of the Helmholtz Center in Munich and colleagues discovered this potential role for the skull while probing the idea that the cells in skull marrow might behave differently from those in other bones. Ertürk’s team compared the genetic activity of cells in mice skull marrow, and the proteins those cells made, with those in the rodent’s humerus, femur and four other bones, along with the meninges, the protective membranes between the skull and the brain.Cells in the skull, particularly a type of white blood cell called neutrophils, differed from those in other bones but were similar to those in the meninges, the team found. And brain injury widened those differences. In mice with stroke symptoms, the activity in skull cells of genes related to cell migration and inflammation was higher than in other bone cells, suggesting that the cells respond to whatever is happening in the brain.In another experiment, Ertürk and colleagues compared the profile of proteins in human skull cells with those in the pelvis or the vertebra. Skull marrow cells presented brain proteins while the other bones did not. “This tells us that the communication is two-way,” Ertürk says.Those discoveries seemed important, but only if the skull and brain had a way to send cells back and forth. A few years ago, researchers observed connecting “tunnels” between the skull and the meninges in mice and humans (SN: 8/31/18). More recently, another team showed that immune cells from the skull were actually getting into the brains of mice, an observation made again in the new study.To get a better look at the human tunnels, the team used a technique that makes tissue transparent, along with 3-D imaging, to inspect the bone and tissue of people who had died. That revealed a clear path to connect the skull and meninges, something “never been imaged in that much detail in humans before,” says Meyer zu Hörste.The study “shows the connections very beautifully,” he says, “but how functionally relevant they are still needs to be studied.”The team did track the location and levels of neuroinflammation in the skulls of people who have Alzheimer’s disease, stroke or multiple sclerosis using PET imaging. The pattern of skull inflammation was different with each disease. For example, in people with MS, there was a huge inflammation signal at the base of the skull, which was not present in people with stroke or Alzheimer’s.“The inflammatory signature was moving depending on the nature of the neurological disorder,” says Ilgin Kolabas, a neuroscientist in Ertürk’s lab. The signal even increased in specific regions in the skulls of people with Alzheimer’s, a possible sign of the progression of the disease.Because these signals might be mirroring what is happening in the brain, they could serve as a proxy for neuroinflammation, Kolabas says. The team anticipates these findings could help with both diagnosis and treatment of stroke, Alzheimer’s and other neurological disorders using less invasive methods than spinal taps or other alternatives.But the technology is still not sufficiently advanced for that yet; future studies need to address whether skull inflammation can actually be measured and targeted to attack brain diseases, Meyer zu Hörste says. “There is a lot of work left to be done.”Questions or comments on this article?

65|A new device can detect the coronavirus in the air in minutes|A new device can detect the coronavirus in the air in minutes  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The detector is about as sensitive as a PCR test but quickerA coronavirus detector (illustrated in a 3-D rendering of a proposed final design) can sense airborne SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, in just five minutes.Joseph Puthussery/Washington Univ. in St. LouisBy Tina Hesman SaeyJuly 16, 2023 at 7:00 amIf you’ve ever thought it would be great to walk into a room and know whether the virus that causes COVID-19 is hanging around, scientists have a device for you. Researchers have created a machine a little bigger than a toaster that can detect airborne SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus in minutes.It takes only five minutes to detect as few as seven to 35 viral particles per liter of air, researchers report July 10 in Nature Communications. That is about as sensitive as PCR nasal swab tests, says Rajan Chakrabarty, an aerosol scientist at Washington University in St. Louis. His team worked “nonstop” for three years to create the detector, he says.One of the main challenges when sampling airborne viruses is collecting enough air to concentrate viral particles at detectable levels. Previous attempts have sucked in between 2 and 8 cubic meters of air per minute. This detector pulls in 1,000 cubic meters of air each minute.To trap the virus, “we create an artificial cyclone inside of the sampler,” Chakrabarty says, by swirling liquid at high speed. Viruses get trapped in the wall of the cyclone and concentrated for analysis. Any viruses not captured in the liquid get filtered out of the air with a HEPA filter attached to the device. After five minutes of collection, the liquid is pumped to a biosensor.The biosensor consists of an electrode attached to a llama nanobody, a specialized immune system protein made by llamas and their relatives that fights infections much the way antibodies do but is smaller and perhaps tougher than human antibodies (SN: 9/14/20). The nanobody grabs any passing coronavirus by its spike protein. Electricity passing through the nanobody and spike protein causes tyrosine amino acids in the spike protein to oxidize, or lose electrons. Another device attached to the electrode detects that oxidation as a change in voltage, signaling that SARS-CoV-2 is in the air.  The biosensor is based on a detector for the amyloid-beta protein fragments that form Alzheimer’s disease plaques developed by Chakrabarty’s colleagues Carla Yuede and John Cirrito. To test the detector, the researchers sent the device to the apartments of two people who had COVID-19 infections. “The device was detecting even the trace amounts of virus being shed by the patients,” Chakrabarty says. Air collected from an empty, well-ventilated conference room showed no sign of the virus.“They’ve demonstrated that it works. It’s able to detect [the] virus at low levels that we would be concerned about in the air,” says Linsey Marr, an aerosol scientist at Virginia Tech in Blacksburg who studies the spread of viruses. She was not involved in the study but is working on a detector, too.There are still some challenges to overcome. For instance, the device is about as noisy as a vacuum cleaner or a ringing phone. That’s probably too loud to use continuously in a classroom or office, Marr says, but could be tolerated if run for 10 minutes.Such detectors cost about $1,400 to $1,900 to build in a research lab, Chakrabarty says. Commercial versions may initially be too expensive for home use, Marr says, but could be used in hospitals, airports and other public areas to survey for the virus. The devices could be linked into HVAC systems, which could ramp up ventilation and filtration if the virus is found, Marr and Chakrabarty suggest.In the future, Chakrabarty hopes to add llama nanobodies that can detect other respiratory viruses as well, such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus.Questions or comments on this article?

66|The first gene therapy for muscular dystrophy has been approved for some kids|U.S. Food and Drug AdministrationFDA Approves First Gene Therapy for Treatment of Certain Patients with Duchenne Muscular Dystrophy  The .gov means it’s official.Federal government websites often end in .gov or .mil. Before sharing sensitive information, make sure you're on a federal government site.The site is secure. The https:// ensures that you are connecting to the official website and that any information you provide is encrypted and transmitted securely.FDA News Release EspañolToday, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approved Elevidys, the first gene therapy for the treatment of pediatric patients 4 through 5 years of age with Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene who do not have a pre-existing medical reason preventing treatment with this therapy. “Today’s approval addresses an urgent unmet medical need and is an important advancement in the treatment of Duchenne muscular dystrophy, a devastating condition with limited treatment options, that leads to a progressive deterioration of an individual’s health over time,” said Peter Marks, M.D., Ph.D., director of the FDA’s Center for Biologics Evaluation and Research. “The FDA remains committed to facilitating the development of innovative new therapies to reduce the impact of debilitating diseases and to improve outcomes and quality of life for those affected.”Duchenne muscular dystrophy is a rare and serious genetic condition which worsens over time, leading to weakness and wasting away of the body’s muscles. The disease occurs due to a defective gene that results in absence of dystrophin, a protein that helps keep the body’s muscle cells intact. As a result of this genetic defect, individuals with DMD may have symptoms such as trouble walking and running, falling frequently, fatigue, learning disabilities/difficulties, heart issues as a result of impact on heart muscle functioning, and breathing problems due to weakening of respiratory muscles involved in lung function. Symptoms of muscle weakness associated with DMD typically begin in childhood, often between 3 to 6 years of age. DMD mainly affects males and in rare cases may affect females. About one in every 3,300 boys are affected by this disorder. As the disease progresses, life-threatening heart and respiratory problems can occur. Although disease severity and life expectancy vary, patients often succumb to the disease in their 20s or 30s because of heart and/or respiratory failure. Most current treatment approaches address the symptoms of the disease, but not its underlying genetic cause. Treatments include corticosteroid medications to slow down the progression of muscle weakness, stretching and exercise programs, and use of equipment such as braces or a wheelchair as walking becomes more difficult. Antisense oligonucleotides (ASOs) facilitate exon skipping for specific DMD gene mutations, but the ASOs can only address a minority of the gene mutations and require repeated administration.  Elevidys is a recombinant gene therapy designed to deliver into the body a gene that leads to production of Elevidys micro-dystrophin, a shortened protein (138 kDa, compared to the 427 kDa dystrophin protein of normal muscle cells) that contains selected domains of the dystrophin protein present in normal muscle cells. The product is administered as a single intravenous dose. Elevidys was approved through the Accelerated Approval pathway, under which the FDA may approve drugs for serious or life-threatening diseases where there is an unmet medical need and the drug is shown to have an effect on a surrogate endpoint that is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit to patients (improving how patients feel or function, or whether they survive longer), or an effect on a clinical endpoint that can be measured earlier than irreversible morbidity or mortality that is reasonably likely to predict an effect on irreversible morbidity or mortality or other clinical benefit. This pathway generally provides patients earlier access to promising new drugs while the company conducts clinical trials to verify the predicted clinical benefit.The FDA granted approval based on an evaluation of data submitted by the sponsor. In one study which involved two parts, individuals in part 1—which was randomized, double-blind, and placebo-controlled—were treated with either Elevidys or placebo and followed for 48 weeks. In part 2 of the study, individuals who received placebo during part 1 were treated with Elevidys, and individuals treated with Elevidys during part 1 received a placebo. All individuals were followed for an additional 48 weeks. The accelerated approval of Elevidys was based on data from the randomized clinical trial that established that Elevidys increased the expression of the Elevidys micro-dystrophin protein observed in Elevidys-treated individuals aged 4 to 5 years with DMD. The FDA concluded that the data submitted by the applicant demonstrated that an increase in this surrogate endpoint (expression of Elevidys micro-dystrophin) is reasonably likely to predict clinical benefit in individuals 4 to 5 years of age with DMD who do not have significant pre-existing antibody titers against the AAV rh74 vector or have other contraindications based on the inclusion criteria of the clinical trials. In making this decision, the FDA considered the potential risks associated with the drug, the life-threatening and debilitating nature of the disease for these children, and the urgent unmet medical need. A clinical benefit of Elevidys, including improved motor function, has not been established. As a condition of approval, the FDA is requiring the company to complete a clinical study to confirm the drug’s clinical benefit. The required study is designed to assess whether Elevidys improves physical function and mobility in ambulatory DMD patients with a confirmed mutation in the DMD gene. The study is ongoing and fully enrolled. The agency will review the data from this trial as quickly as possible to consider if further action, such as a revised indication or withdrawal of Elevidys, may be necessary.The most commonly reported side effects by individuals who received Elevidys were vomiting, nausea, acute liver injury, pyrexia (fever) and thrombocytopenia (abnormally low platelet count in the blood). Patients’ liver function should be monitored before treatment with Elevidys, and weekly for the first three months after treatment. Patients given Elevidys may also be at risk for severe immune-mediated myositis (muscle inflammation). Additionally, myocarditis (inflammation of heart muscle) and elevations of troponin-I (a heart protein found in the blood after heart muscle injury) have been observed following use of Elevidys in clinical trials. Troponin-I levels should be monitored before administration of Elevidys and weekly for the first month after treatment. The FDA granted accelerated approval of Elevidys to Sarepta Therapeutics, Inc.###The FDA, an agency within the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, protects the public health by assuring the safety, effectiveness, and security of human and veterinary drugs, vaccines and other biological products for human use, and medical devices. The agency also is responsible for the safety and security of our nation’s food supply, cosmetics, dietary supplements, products that give off electronic radiation, and for regulating tobacco products.06/23/2023  More Press Announcements|True|True
67|Deblina Sarkar is building microscopic machines to enter our brains|Deblina Sarkar is building microscopic machines to enter our brains  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	She dreams of using the ultratiny devices to cure brain diseasesDeblina Sarkar wants to develop miniature machines that may one day help treat Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions.Jimmy Day, MIT Media LabBy Nikk OgasaMay 23, 2023 at 8:00 amDeblina Sarkar makes little machines, for which she has big dreams. The machines are so little, in fact, that they can humbly inhabit living cells. And her dreams are so big, they may one day save your mind.Sarkar is a nanotechnologist and assistant professor at MIT. She develops ultratiny electronic devices, some smaller than a mote of dust, that she hopes will one day enter the brain. She’s also a fan of Kung Fu movies and likes to dance her own twist on bharata natyam, a classical Indian dance form. Occasionally she goes hiking with her graduate students, once taking them as far as Yellowstone. Building camaraderie is vital, Sarkar says. But “I’m probably working day and night on my research,” she confesses. “There is an urgent problem at hand.”That problem is Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and other neurological afflictions that assault the minds of millions of people worldwide. Sarkar’s solution: Employ minute machines to detect and reverse these disorders.“She was always interested in applying … electronics to biological systems,” says collaborator and bioengineering researcher Samir Mitragotri of Harvard University, who has known Sarkar for about a decade and was on her thesis committee. She envisions using her tools to “transform how people are conducting biology,” he says, “bridging the worlds.”Born in Kolkata, India, Sarkar credits both of her parents as early inspirations. Her boldness as a researcher comes from her mother, who as a young woman defied social norms in her village by working to fund her own education and speaking out against the dowry system. Meanwhile, Sarkar’s father sparked her fascination for engineering.At the age of 15, he abandoned his dreams of becoming an engineer to find other jobs; he needed to support his parents and the rest of his family after his father, an Indian freedom fighter, was shot in the leg and could no longer work. Still, Sarkar recalls her father finding time for his passion, fashioning devices to make home life more convenient. These included an electricity-free washing machine and vehicles that could freight hefty loads down local byroads to their house.“That got me very, very interested in science and technology,” Sarkar says. “Engineering specifically.”After earning a bachelor’s degree in electrical engineering from the Indian Institute of Technology Dhanbad, Sarkar moved to California to study nanoelectronics at the University of California, Santa Barbara. There, she tested new ways to create nanodevices that could reduce the amount of power consumed by computers and other everyday electronics.One standout device Sarkar developed during her graduate work was a transistor that reduced the amount of power lost as heat by 90 percent compared with some of today’s most common silicon transistors (SN: 3/18/22). For the breakthrough, UC Santa Barbara awarded Sarkar’s Ph.D. dissertation the Lancaster Award for its impact in advancing math, physical sciences and engineering.Along the way, Sarkar became fascinated with the brain, which she calls “the lowest energy computer.” A project imaging amyloid-beta plaques as a postdoc at MIT opened the door to fusing her dual interests, and she stayed on as an assistant professor to found the Nano-Cybernetic Biotrek group. Her group develops nanodevices that can interface with living cells, and “neuromorphic” computing devices, which have architectures inspired by the human brain and nervous system.  So far, the group’s most innovative device may be the Cell Rover, a flat antenna that could monitor processes inside cells. For a study reported in 2022, Sarkar and her colleagues used magnetic fields to finesse a Cell Rover, roughly the size of a tardigrade, into a mature frog egg cell. The team demonstrated that when stimulated by a magnetic field created by an alternating current, molecules in the nanodevice vibrated at frequencies safe for living cells. Using a wire coil receiver, the researchers were able to detect how those vibrations affected the device’s own magnetic field, thus showing it could communicate with the outside world. Cell Rovers could be outfitted with films that latch onto and detect select proteins or other biomolecules.Sarkar envisions using the device to spot misfolded proteins in the brain that may be early signs of Alzheimer’s disease. Today, memory loss is the only way to know a living person has Alzheimer’s, but by then, the damage is irreversible, Sarkar says. Cell Rovers could also be paired with nanodevices that harvest energy from and electrically stimulate cells, opening the door for new types of brain electrodes and subcellular pacemakers. Or fleets of remotely controlled devices could replace invasive surgeries — detecting a small tumor growing in the brain, for example, and maybe even killing it.She’s essentially establishing a new field of science, at the intersection of nanoelectronics and biology, Mitragotri says. “There are many opportunities for the future.”One day, Sarkar hopes to insert nanodevices between human neurons to boost the computing speed of the fleshy processor already in our skulls. Our brains are remarkable, she says, but “we could be better than what we are.”Deblina Sarkar is one of this year’s SN 10: Scientists to Watch, our list of 10 early and mid-career scientists who are making extraordinary contributions to their field.

But researchers may have found an antidote for one of the mushroom’s most deadly toxins.A dye already used in medical procedures can block damage from the mushroom’s alpha-amanitin toxin, researchers report May 16 in Nature Communications. The work was done with human cells grown in lab dishes and with mice. If the finding holds up in trials with people, the antidote has potential to save lives.Death cap mushrooms (Amanita phalloides) are responsible for the majority of deaths from mushroom poisonings worldwide. Symptoms may appear as soon as six hours after ingestion and include nausea, vomiting and diarrhea. If a person isn’t treated immediately, the toxins can cause liver and kidney damage that can lead to death within 48 hours after ingestion. There is no antidote currently available, but people can be treated with fluids, activated charcoal and other therapies.How alpha-amanitin kills isn’t fully understood. A team of researchers in China and Australia used the gene editor CRISPR/Cas9 to determine which human genes the toxin triggers to cause cell damage and death (SN: 10/7/20). One of those genes makes a protein called STT3B, which helps attach sugars to proteins. Scientists hadn’t known that that process was important for mushroom toxicity.The team then screened a library of more than 3,000 drugs approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration for molecules that could inhibit STT3B’s action. The team found that the dye indocyanine green could stop the protein from doing its job and prevent human cells in lab dishes from dying after being treated with alpha-amanitin.In tests with mice poisoned with alpha-amanitin, the dye reduced liver and kidney damage and increased survival rates if given one to four hours after poisoning. Waiting eight to 12 hours to administer the antidote reduced its effectiveness, the team found, probably because irreversible organ damage had already occurred.Questions or comments on this article?

70|A flower-shaped soft robot could make brain monitoring less invasive|A flower-shaped soft robot could make brain monitoring less invasive  Every print subscription comes with full digital access 	The flexible sensor array would be deployed through a small hole in the skullA new type of brain sensor consists of flexible “petals” (pictured) that are inverted into a central hub before insertion through a small hole in the skull and then “bloom” outward to lie flat on the brain's surface.Alain Herzog/École Polytechnique Fédérale de LausanneBy Bob HirshonMay 10, 2023 at 2:00 pmA tiny, flexible machine might one day help neuroscientists eavesdrop on electrical activity in the brain, allowing them to pinpoint and potentially treat seizures.Inserted into the skull through a hole just 1 to 2 centimeters wide, the flower-shaped device unfurls a flexible array of sensors that contact the brain’s surface, allowing it to monitor electrical activity, researchers report May 10 in Science Robotics. A successful demonstration on a minipig suggests the device could be a less invasive way to place sensors directly on the brain, which currently can require removal of a large section of skull.The device is known as a soft robot: soft, because unlike traditional mechanical devices, it’s made of flexible materials, and robot, because its sensory apparatus moves, opening like a flower once implanted (SN: 3/3/21).“Of all the soft robotics that I’ve seen, it’s kind of the one that you say, ‘Wow, this is really going to change, potentially, the way we do things in neurosurgery,’” says Joseph Madsen, a neurosurgeon at Harvard Medical School who was not involved in the study. “The idea of a robot that kind of internally unfolds and goes over the brain is just very elegant.”The robotic device consists of a central hub surrounded by six flat, petal-shaped sensors made of a soft, flexible material. At first, the petals are inverted into the hub. “It’s a bit like a glove where … you flip it outside in,” says Stéphanie Lacour, a bioengineer at École Polytechnique Fédérale de Lausanne in Geneva.Once inside the skull, a flow of saline solution through the hub gently forces the petals open, where they then lay flat against the surface of the cerebral cortex. Sensors in each petal signal when they’re in place and then start monitoring the brain, sending information back to a monitor via electrical wires.Lacour and colleagues tested a prototype in the brain of a minipig, successfully deploying the roughly daisy-sized sensor array inside the skull and recording electrical activity. The technology could be sized up to cover a larger area for human use, Lacour says. Future versions could be bidirectional, she says, not only sensing brain activity but also stimulating it. That might allow the device to stop seizure activity before it begins, stimulate brain areas damaged by stroke or act as a brain-machine interface to allow people to control devices (SN: 2/11/21).The researchers have created a company to further develop the technology and conduct the additional testing that will be required to gain approval for use in human patients.Questions or comments on this article?
